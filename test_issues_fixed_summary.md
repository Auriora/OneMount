# Summary of Test Issues Fixed

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address the test issues identified in the 'fusefs_tests.log' and 'fusefs_tests.race.715957' files. All identified issues have been successfully fixed and documented.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Race Conditions in socketio-go Integration

**Problem**: Multiple data race conditions were detected between goroutines in the socketio-go library integration, specifically between the `recvLoop()` method and the goroutine that calls `setupEventChan()`.

**Solution**: Modified the `setupEventChan()` method in `subscription.go` to ensure proper synchronization:
- Added a ready channel to synchronize connection establishment
- Added an error channel to handle connection errors
- Created a connection ready handler that signals when the connection is fully established
- Moved the `sioc.Connect()` call to a separate goroutine to avoid blocking
- Added a select statement to wait for the connection to be ready, an error to occur, or the context to be done
- Added proper cleanup in case of errors or context cancellation

### 2. Database Access Issues

**Problem**: Database access conflicts were occurring during tests, resulting in "Could not open DB. Is it already in use by another mount?" errors.

**Solution**: Improved the database connection handling in the `NewFilesystem()` function in `cache.go`:
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for opening the database
- Added code to check for and remove stale lock files
- Improved error logging with more detailed information
- Set reasonable retry parameters (5 retries with backoff from 100ms to 2s)

### 3. D-Bus Conflicts

**Problem**: D-Bus name conflicts were occurring during tests, resulting in "D-Bus name already taken" errors.

**Solution**: Modified the D-Bus service name handling in `dbus.go`:
- Changed the `DBusServiceName` from a constant to a variable that can be set dynamically
- Added an initialization function that generates a unique D-Bus service name when running in a test environment
- The unique name includes the process ID and a timestamp to ensure uniqueness across test runs
- Improved the `Stop()` method to properly release the D-Bus name and unexport objects before closing the connection
- Added better error handling and logging for D-Bus resource cleanup

## Conclusion

All the identified test issues have been successfully fixed. The changes made improve the robustness of the test environment by:

1. Eliminating race conditions in the socketio-go integration
2. Making database connections more resilient with retry logic and proper cleanup
3. Preventing D-Bus name conflicts by using unique service names for test instances

These improvements should result in more reliable and consistent test runs, reducing the likelihood of test failures due to infrastructure issues rather than actual code problems.
