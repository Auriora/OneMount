# Test Code Refactoring Status

This document summarizes the status of the recommendations from the [test_code_refactoring.md](test_code_refactoring.md) document.

## Recommendations Status

### 1. Create Test Utilities Package (COMPLETED)

**Implementation**: Created and enhanced the `testutil` package with common test utilities:
- Added file operation utilities in `testutil/file.go` with functions for creating test files, directories, and checking file existence and content
- Added test fixtures in `testutil/fixtures.go` with functions for creating standard test data and fixtures for DriveItem and related types
- Added async operation utilities in `testutil/async.go` with functions for waiting for conditions, retrying operations with backoff, and handling timeouts

### 2. Standardize Test Patterns (IN PROGRESS)

**Implementation**: Update tests to use consistent patterns:
- Implement consistent use of `t.Parallel()` (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
  - Added `t.Parallel()` to all appropriate tests in the fs/graph package
  - Added `t.Parallel()` to all appropriate tests in the cmd/common package
  - Identified tests that should not use `t.Parallel()` due to shared state (e.g., offline_test.go, fs_test.go)
  - Reviewed ui package tests and found that some tests already use `t.Parallel()` while others need to be updated
  - Reviewed fs/offline package tests and found that most tests already use `t.Parallel()` with comments explaining why some don't
- Implement consistent resource cleanup with `t.Cleanup()` (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
  - Replaced all `defer` statements with `t.Cleanup()` in the fs/graph package tests
  - Reviewed fs package tests and found they already use `t.Cleanup()` for most resource cleanup
  - Added improved error handling in cleanup functions
  - Updated cmd/common package tests to use `t.Cleanup()` for resource cleanup
  - Identified that ui package tests need to be updated to use `t.Cleanup()` instead of defer
  - Identified that fs/offline package tests mostly use `t.Cleanup()` but some still use defer
- Implement consistent assertion style using `require` and `assert` (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
  - Updated all tests in the fs/graph package to use `require` for critical assertions and `assert` for non-critical assertions
  - Reviewed fs package tests and found they already use a mix of `require` and `assert` appropriately
  - Updated cmd/common package tests to use `require` for critical assertions and `assert` for non-critical assertions
  - Added clear error messages to all assertions
  - Identified that ui package tests need to be updated to use `require` for critical assertions
  - Identified that fs/offline package tests mostly use `require` but some still use t.Fatal/t.Error

### 3. Improve Test Reliability (NOT STARTED)

**Implementation**: Make tests more reliable:
- Replace fixed timeouts with dynamic waiting
- Fix race conditions in tests
- Isolate tests from each other

### 4. Improve Error Handling (NOT STARTED)

**Implementation**: Enhance error handling in tests:
- Add context to error messages
- Test error conditions explicitly

### 5. Improve Test Organization (NOT STARTED)

**Implementation**: Better organize tests:
- Convert appropriate tests to table-driven tests
- Group related tests
- Use clear test names

## Next Steps

1. Continue standardizing test patterns in remaining packages:
   - Update ui package tests:
     - Add t.Parallel() to TestMountpointIsValid and TestHomeEscapeUnescape in ui/onedriver_test.go
     - Replace defer with t.Cleanup() in ui/setup_test.go and ui/systemd/setup_test.go
     - Update TestMountpointIsValid to use require instead of assert for critical assertions
     - Convert TestMountpointIsValid and TestHomeEscapeUnescape to use proper subtests
   - Update fs/offline package tests:
     - Replace t.Fatal/t.Error with require/assert in TestOfflineReaddir and TestOfflineBagelDetection
     - Replace defer with t.Cleanup() in setup_test.go

2. Begin implementing test reliability improvements:
   - Replace fixed timeouts with dynamic waiting using the new testutil/async.go utilities:
     - Update TestUnitActive in ui/systemd/systemd_test.go to use WaitForCondition instead of fixed timeout
     - Update setup_test.go in fs/offline to use WaitForCondition for mount point checks
   - Fix race conditions in tests, particularly in TestUploadDiskSerialization
   - Isolate tests from each other by using subtests and proper cleanup
