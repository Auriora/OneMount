# Test Code Refactoring Status

This document summarizes the status of the recommendations from the [test_code_refactoring.md](test_code_refactoring.md) document.

## Recommendations Status

### 1. Create Test Utilities Package (COMPLETED)

**Implementation**: Created and enhanced the `testutil` package with common test utilities:
- Added file operation utilities in `testutil/file.go` with functions for creating test files, directories, and checking file existence and content
- Added test fixtures in `testutil/fixtures.go` with functions for creating standard test data and fixtures for DriveItem and related types
- Added async operation utilities in `testutil/async.go` with functions for waiting for conditions, retrying operations with backoff, and handling timeouts

### 2. Standardize Test Patterns (IN PROGRESS)

**Implementation**: Update tests to use consistent patterns:
- Implement consistent use of `t.Parallel()` (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
  - Added `t.Parallel()` to all appropriate tests in the fs/graph package
  - Added `t.Parallel()` to all appropriate tests in the cmd/common package
  - Identified tests that should not use `t.Parallel()` due to shared state (e.g., offline_test.go, fs_test.go)
  - Reviewed ui package tests and found that some tests already use `t.Parallel()` while others need to be updated
  - Reviewed fs/offline package tests and found that most tests already use `t.Parallel()` with comments explaining why some don't
- Implement consistent resource cleanup with `t.Cleanup()` (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
  - Replaced all `defer` statements with `t.Cleanup()` in the fs/graph package tests
  - Reviewed fs package tests and found they already use `t.Cleanup()` for most resource cleanup
  - Added improved error handling in cleanup functions
  - Updated cmd/common package tests to use `t.Cleanup()` for resource cleanup
  - Identified that ui package tests need to be updated to use `t.Cleanup()` instead of defer
  - Identified that fs/offline package tests mostly use `t.Cleanup()` but some still use defer
- Implement consistent assertion style using `require` and `assert` (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
  - Updated all tests in the fs/graph package to use `require` for critical assertions and `assert` for non-critical assertions
  - Reviewed fs package tests and found they already use a mix of `require` and `assert` appropriately
  - Updated cmd/common package tests to use `require` for critical assertions and `assert` for non-critical assertions
  - Added clear error messages to all assertions
  - Identified that ui package tests need to be updated to use `require` for critical assertions
  - Identified that fs/offline package tests mostly use `require` but some still use t.Fatal/t.Error

### 3. Improve Test Reliability (IN PROGRESS)

**Implementation**: Make tests more reliable:
- Replace fixed timeouts with dynamic waiting (COMPLETED)
  - Added WaitForCondition utility in testutil/async.go to replace fixed timeouts with dynamic waiting
  - Updated TestUnitActive in ui/systemd/systemd_test.go to use WaitForCondition instead of fixed timeout
  - Updated setup_test.go in fs/offline to use WaitForCondition for mount point checks and other waiting operations
  - Added RetryWithBackoff utility in testutil/async.go for operations that need multiple attempts
  - Replaced all fixed sleeps in fs/fs_test.go with WaitForCondition:
    - Updated TestTouchUpdateTime to wait for file modification time to change
    - Updated TestMkdirRmdir to wait for directory removal
    - Updated TestNTFSIsABadFilesystem and its variants to wait for file operations
    - Updated TestEchoWritesToFile to wait for file content
    - Updated TestStat to wait for directory creation
    - Updated TestGIOTrash to wait for file creation and deletion
- Fix race conditions in tests (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
  - Fixed race conditions in TestUploadDiskSerialization by making the test more deterministic
  - Improved TestRepeatedUploads to use dynamic waiting instead of fixed sleeps
- Isolate tests from each other (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
  - Converted TestChmod to TestFilePermissions using table-driven tests with subtests
  - Added unique filenames for each subtest to avoid conflicts
  - Added proper cleanup for each subtest
  - Converted TestMountpointIsValid in ui/onedriver_test.go to use table-driven tests with subtests
  - Converted TestHomeEscapeUnescape in ui/onedriver_test.go to use table-driven tests with subtests
  - Added nested subtests for testing related operations

### 4. Improve Error Handling (IN PROGRESS)

**Implementation**: Enhance error handling in tests:
- Add context to error messages (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
  - Updated TestOfflineReaddir in fs/offline/offline_test.go to use require with descriptive error messages
  - Updated TestOfflineBagelDetection in fs/offline/offline_test.go to use require with descriptive error messages
  - Added better error reporting with context about what's being tested
  - Added proper error handling for previously ignored errors
- Test error conditions explicitly (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
  - Updated TestGetAccountName in ui/onedriver_test.go to test error conditions:
    - Added test case for nonexistent auth_tokens.json file
    - Added test case for invalid JSON in auth_tokens.json file
    - Added test case for empty Account field in auth_tokens.json file
  - Converted TestGetAccountName to use table-driven tests with subtests
  - Added proper error handling and descriptive error messages

### 5. Improve Test Organization (IN PROGRESS)

**Implementation**: Better organize tests:
- Convert appropriate tests to table-driven tests (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
  - Reviewed fs/graph package tests and found that many tests already use table-driven approach:
    - TestIDPath, TestChildrenPath, and TestChildrenPathID in path_test.go
    - TestSHA256Hash, TestSHA256HashStream, TestSHA1Hash, TestSHA1HashStream, TestQuickXORHash, and TestQuickXORHashStream in hash_functions_test.go
  - Reviewed ui package tests and found that several tests already use table-driven approach:
    - TestMountpointIsValid, TestHomeEscapeUnescape, and TestGetAccountName in ui/onedriver_test.go
  - Converted TestChmod to TestFilePermissions using table-driven tests with subtests in fs/fs_test.go
- Group related tests (NOT STARTED)
- Use clear test names (NOT STARTED)

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing test reliability improvements:
   - Isolate tests from each other by using subtests and proper cleanup:
     - Convert more tests to use table-driven tests with subtests where appropriate
     - Add parallel execution to subtests where possible
     - Ensure proper cleanup for all tests
   - Fix race conditions in tests:
     - Identify and fix any remaining race conditions in tests
     - Run tests with the -race flag to detect race conditions

2. Continue implementing test organization improvements:
   - Convert more appropriate tests to table-driven tests:
     - Focus on tests in fs package that test similar functionality with different inputs
     - Potential candidates include:
       - TestDeltaMkdir, TestDeltaRmdir, TestDeltaRename, and TestDeltaMoveParent in fs/delta_test.go
       - TestUntemplateUnit in ui/systemd/systemd_test.go
   - Group related tests:
     - Organize tests by functionality rather than by implementation details
     - Use clear naming conventions for test functions
   - Improve test naming conventions:
     - Use descriptive names that indicate what is being tested
     - Follow a consistent naming pattern across all tests
