# Test Code Refactoring Status

This document summarizes the status of the recommendations from the [test_code_refactoring.md](test_code_refactoring.md) document.

## Recommendations Status

### 1. Create Test Utilities Package (COMPLETED)

**Implementation**: Created and enhanced the `testutil` package with common test utilities:
- Added file operation utilities in `testutil/file.go` with functions for creating test files, directories, and checking file existence and content
- Added test fixtures in `testutil/fixtures.go` with functions for creating standard test data and fixtures for DriveItem and related types
- Added async operation utilities in `testutil/async.go` with functions for waiting for conditions, retrying operations with backoff, and handling timeouts

### 2. Standardize Test Patterns (IN PROGRESS)

**Implementation**: Update tests to use consistent patterns:
- Implement consistent use of `t.Parallel()` (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
  - Added `t.Parallel()` to all appropriate tests in the fs/graph package
  - Identified tests that should not use `t.Parallel()` due to shared state (e.g., offline_test.go)
- Implement consistent resource cleanup with `t.Cleanup()`
- Implement consistent assertion style using `require` and `assert`

### 3. Improve Test Reliability (NOT STARTED)

**Implementation**: Make tests more reliable:
- Replace fixed timeouts with dynamic waiting
- Fix race conditions in tests
- Isolate tests from each other

### 4. Improve Error Handling (NOT STARTED)

**Implementation**: Enhance error handling in tests:
- Add context to error messages
- Test error conditions explicitly

### 5. Improve Test Organization (NOT STARTED)

**Implementation**: Better organize tests:
- Convert appropriate tests to table-driven tests
- Group related tests
- Use clear test names

## Next Steps

Continue implementation of the recommendations by standardizing test patterns across the project.
