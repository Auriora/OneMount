# OneMount Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the OneMount project, defining how different types of tests are integrated into the development process and CI/CD pipeline. It also specifies the documentation required for each test type, how test traceability is mapped and recorded, and how test results are recorded and stored.

## 2. Test Types and Process Integration

The OneMount project employs a comprehensive testing approach that includes various test types at different stages of the development process. This section outlines when each type of test is used in the development lifecycle.

### 2.1 Unit Testing

**Stage in Process**: Development Phase

Unit tests are written and executed during the development phase, ideally following a test-driven development (TDD) approach where tests are written before the implementation code.

**Process Integration**:
1. Developers write unit tests for new features or bug fixes
2. Tests are run locally before committing code
3. All unit tests are executed automatically when code is pushed to the repository
4. Code reviews include verification of unit test coverage and quality

### 2.2 Integration Testing

**Stage in Process**: Development and Integration Phases

Integration tests are written during development and executed during both development and integration phases to verify that components work correctly together.

**Process Integration**:
1. Integration tests are developed alongside unit tests for new features
2. Tests are run locally before committing code that affects multiple components
3. All integration tests are executed automatically when code is pushed to the repository
4. More comprehensive integration tests are run during the integration phase

### 2.3 System Testing

**Stage in Process**: Integration and Testing Phases

System tests verify the complete integrated system and are executed during the integration and testing phases.

**Process Integration**:
1. System tests are developed based on system requirements
2. Tests are executed after successful integration of components
3. System tests verify end-to-end functionality
4. All system tests must pass before proceeding to acceptance testing

### 2.4 Performance Testing

**Stage in Process**: Testing Phase

Performance tests measure system performance under various conditions and are executed during the testing phase.

**Process Integration**:
1. Performance tests are developed based on performance requirements
2. Baseline performance measurements are established
3. Performance tests are executed on a production-like environment
4. Results are compared against performance thresholds
5. Performance regression testing is performed for significant changes

### 2.5 Security Testing

**Stage in Process**: Testing Phase

Security tests identify vulnerabilities and security issues and are executed during the testing phase.

**Process Integration**:
1. Security tests are developed based on security requirements
2. Security scanning is performed regularly
3. Penetration testing is conducted on a production-like environment
4. Security issues are addressed before release
5. Security regression testing is performed for significant changes

### 2.6 Acceptance Testing

**Stage in Process**: Acceptance Phase

Acceptance tests validate that the system meets user requirements and are executed during the acceptance phase.

**Process Integration**:
1. Acceptance tests are developed based on user requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Tests are executed on a production-like environment
3. User feedback is collected and analyzed
4. All acceptance criteria must be met before release

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline Integration

This section describes how each test type is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

## 5. Test Traceability

This section defines how test traceability is mapped and recorded.

### 5.1 Traceability Matrix

The OneMount project uses a comprehensive traceability matrix to map relationships between:
- Requirements (functional and non-functional)
- Architecture elements
- Design elements
- Test cases

The traceability matrix is maintained in the `test-cases-traceability-matrix.md` document and includes:
- Requirement ID and description
- References to the Architecture Specification
- References to the Design Specification
- Test Case IDs that verify the requirement

### 5.2 Traceability in Test Cases

Each test case includes traceability information:
- Test Case ID: A unique identifier for the test case
- Requirements Covered: IDs of requirements verified by the test case
- Architecture Elements Covered: References to architecture elements verified by the test case
- Design Elements Covered: References to design elements verified by the test case

### 5.3 Traceability Maintenance

Traceability is maintained throughout the development process:
1. When requirements change, the traceability matrix is updated to reflect the changes
2. When new test cases are added, they are linked to the requirements they verify
3. When test cases are modified, their traceability information is updated
4. Regular reviews ensure that all requirements have adequate test coverage

### 5.4 Traceability Reporting

Traceability reports are generated to provide insights into test coverage:
- Requirements coverage report: Shows which requirements are covered by tests and identifies gaps
- Test case coverage report: Shows which test cases cover which requirements
- Traceability gap analysis: Identifies requirements without adequate test coverage

## 6. Test Results Recording and Storage

This section defines how test results are recorded and stored.

### 6.1 Test Results Data Model

Test results are recorded using a structured data model:
- Test Run ID: A unique identifier for the test run
- Test Case ID: The ID of the test case being executed
- Status: The outcome of the test (Passed, Failed, Skipped)
- Timestamp: When the test was executed
- Duration: How long the test took to execute
- Environment: The environment in which the test was executed
- Version: The version of the software being tested
- Failures: Details of any failures, including:
  - Message: The failure message
  - Location: Where the failure occurred
  - Expected vs. Actual: What was expected and what actually happened
- Artifacts: Any artifacts generated during the test, including:
  - Name: The name of the artifact
  - Type: The type of artifact (log, screenshot, etc.)
  - Location: Where the artifact is stored

### 6.2 Test Results Storage

Test results are stored in multiple locations:
1. **Local Storage**: During test execution, results are stored locally in the test environment
2. **CI/CD System**: Test results are uploaded to the CI/CD system for immediate access
3. **Test Results Database**: A dedicated database stores historical test results for trend analysis
4. **Artifact Repository**: Test artifacts are stored in an artifact repository for long-term access

### 6.3 Test Results Reporting

Test results are reported through various mechanisms:
1. **CI/CD Dashboard**: Real-time test results are displayed on the CI/CD dashboard
2. **Test Reports**: Detailed test reports are generated after each test run
3. **Trend Analysis**: Historical test results are analyzed to identify trends
4. **Notification System**: Test failures trigger notifications to relevant stakeholders

### 6.4 Test Results Retention

Test results are retained according to the following policy:
1. **Recent Results**: Detailed results for recent test runs (last 30 days) are retained in full
2. **Historical Results**: Summarized results for older test runs are retained for trend analysis
3. **Release Results**: Full results for tests associated with releases are retained indefinitely
4. **Failure Results**: Detailed results for test failures are retained until the issue is resolved

## 7. Conclusion
