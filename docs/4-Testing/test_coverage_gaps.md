## Recommendations Summary

1. **Prioritize UI Testing**: Develop test cases for both CLI and GUI functionality, as these are completely missing from the current test suite.
2. **Add Statistics Command Tests**: Create test cases for the statistics command and its various analysis features.
3. **Enhance Integration Testing**: Expand test coverage for D-Bus interface and Nemo file manager integration.
4. **Implement Developer Tools Tests**: Add test cases for method logging framework and developer tools.
5. **Address Non-Functional Requirements**: Create test cases for usability, reliability, and maintainability requirements.
6. **Test Architectural Decisions**: Ensure all architectural decisions are properly tested, especially GTK3 and zerolog integration.
7. **Cover Missing Use Cases**: Develop test cases for the statistics analysis use case.

By addressing these gaps, the onedriver project can improve its test coverage and ensure that all requirements, architectural elements, and design elements are properly verified.
