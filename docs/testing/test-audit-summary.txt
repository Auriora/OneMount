=== TEST AUDIT SUMMARY STATISTICS ===
Generated: January 22, 2026

Total Tests: 752

=== Tests by Current Label ===
TestUT_: 288 (38.3%)
TestIT_: 138 (18.4%)
TestProperty: 94 (12.5%)
TestSystemST_: 6 (0.8%)
NONE (Unlabeled): 226 (30.0%)

=== Tests by Recommendation ===
OK (Correctly labeled): 460 (61.2%)
MISLABELED (Critical): 66 (8.8%)
ADD label needed: 59 (7.8%)
REVIEW needed: 167 (22.2%)

=== Critical Issues ===

1. MISLABELED TESTS (66 tests)
   - Tests labeled as TestUT_ but requiring authentication
   - These will fail when run as unit tests without auth tokens
   - Must be either relabeled as TestIT_ or refactored to use mocks

2. UNLABELED TESTS (226 tests)
   - 30% of all tests have no type label
   - Cannot determine which tests require auth
   - Cannot run specific test types in isolation
   - Blocks proper CI/CD configuration

3. UNCLEAR AUTH REQUIREMENTS (167 tests)
   - Need manual review to determine if auth is required
   - May be using indirect auth dependencies
   - Should be reviewed and properly labeled

=== Action Items ===

Priority 1 (CRITICAL):
- Fix 66 mislabeled TestUT_ tests that require auth
- Label 59 tests that clearly need labels

Priority 2 (HIGH):
- Review 167 tests with unclear auth requirements
- Create separate test fixtures (Task 46.1.2)
- Refactor unit tests to use mocks (Task 46.1.3)

Priority 3 (MEDIUM):
- Add skip logic to integration tests (Task 46.1.4)
- Verify system tests (Task 46.1.5)
- Update documentation

=== Files with Most Issues ===

Top files with mislabeled tests:
- internal/fs/advanced_mounting_test.go (4 mislabeled)
- internal/fs/cache_management_test.go (5 mislabeled)
- internal/fs/dir_operations_test.go (4 mislabeled)
- internal/fs/file_operations_test.go (3 mislabeled)
- internal/fs/file_read_verification_test.go (2 mislabeled)
- internal/fs/file_write_verification_test.go (2 mislabeled)

Top files with unlabeled tests:
- internal/fs/cache_test.go (5 unlabeled)
- internal/fs/concurrency_test.go (6 unlabeled)
- internal/fs/dbus_test.go (8 unlabeled)
- internal/fs/delta_test.go (10 unlabeled)
- internal/testutil/framework/*_test.go (many unlabeled)

=== Impact ===

Current State:
- Unit test runs fail when auth tokens are missing
- Cannot run fast unit tests in isolation
- CI/CD pipelines waste resources on failing tests
- Test execution time is unpredictable

After Remediation:
- Unit tests run independently without auth
- Integration tests skip gracefully when auth unavailable
- CI/CD pipelines are efficient
- Developers can run fast feedback loops

=== Next Steps ===

1. Review detailed CSV: docs/testing/test-audit-detailed.csv
2. Fix mislabeled tests (Priority 1)
3. Label unlabeled tests (Priority 1)
4. Create test fixtures (Task 46.1.2)
5. Refactor unit tests (Task 46.1.3)
6. Add skip logic (Task 46.1.4)
7. Verify system tests (Task 46.1.5)
