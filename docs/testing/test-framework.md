# OneMount Test Framework Documentation

## Overview

The OneMount Test Framework is a comprehensive testing infrastructure designed to support various types of testing for the OneMount filesystem. It provides a structured approach to testing, with components for unit testing, integration testing, system testing, performance testing, load testing, and security testing.

This documentation provides a detailed overview of the test framework architecture, API documentation for all components, examples of how to use each component, best practices for writing different types of tests, and troubleshooting guidance for common issues.

## Architecture

The OneMount Test Framework is built around a core `TestFramework` class that provides centralized test configuration and execution. This core framework is extended by specialized frameworks for different types of testing:

### Core Components

1. **TestFramework**: The central component that provides test configuration, resource management, mock provider registration, test execution, and context management.

2. **NetworkSimulator**: Simulates different network conditions for testing, including latency, packet loss, bandwidth limitations, and network disconnections.

3. **MockProviders**: Mock implementations of system components for isolated testing, including:
   - MockGraphProvider: Simulates Microsoft Graph API responses
   - MockFileSystemProvider: Simulates filesystem operations
   - MockUIProvider: Simulates UI interactions

4. **CoverageReporter**: Collects and reports test coverage metrics, including line, function, and branch coverage.

### Specialized Frameworks

1. **IntegrationTestEnvironment**: Provides a controlled environment for integration tests, with support for component isolation, network simulation, and test data management.

2. **SystemTestEnvironment**: Extends the integration test environment for system-level testing, with support for end-to-end scenarios and production-like data volumes.

3. **PerformanceBenchmark**: Provides utilities for performance testing, including metrics collection, threshold checking, and result visualization.

4. **SecurityTestFramework**: Extends the test framework with security-specific testing capabilities, including vulnerability scanning and security control verification.

## Test Types

The OneMount Test Framework supports various types of testing, each with its own specialized components and best practices:

- [Unit Testing](unit-testing.md): Testing individual components in isolation
- [Integration Testing](integration-testing.md): Testing component interactions
- [System Testing](system-testing.md): Testing the entire system end-to-end
- [Performance Testing](performance-testing.md): Testing system performance under various conditions
- [Load Testing](load-testing.md): Testing system behavior under load
- [Security Testing](security-testing.md): Testing system security

## Best Practices
