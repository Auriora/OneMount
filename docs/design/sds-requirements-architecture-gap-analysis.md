## 5. Summary of Recommendations

1. **Add Missing Components**: Develop design specifications for statistics functionality, Nemo integration, and developer tools.
   - **Status**: Partially implemented. Developer tools have been implemented, but statistics functionality and detailed Nemo integration design are still missing.

2. **Enhance Offline Functionality**: Provide more detailed design for network detection and synchronization processes.
   - **Status**: Mostly implemented. Synchronization of offline changes has been implemented, but network detection design could be improved.

3. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance design for retry logic, rate limiting, and crash recovery.
   - **Status**: Mostly implemented. Retry logic and crash recovery have been implemented, but rate limiting design could be improved.

4. **Clarify Architectural Decisions**: Add more detail on logging architecture, concurrency control, and cache management.
   - **Status**: Mostly implemented. Logging architecture and cache management have been implemented, but concurrency control design could be improved.

5. **Complete Use Case Implementations**: Ensure all use cases have comprehensive design specifications.
   - **Status**: Partially implemented. File conflict handling has been implemented, but statistics functionality and detailed Nemo integration design are still missing.

6. **Address Non-Functional Requirements**: Develop design specifications for documentation, testing, and project structure.
   - **Status**: Mostly implemented. Documentation and project structure have been implemented, but test architecture design could be improved.

By addressing the remaining gaps, the Software Design Specification will provide a more complete implementation of the requirements and architectural decisions specified in the SRS and SAS. The most significant remaining gaps are in the statistics functionality and detailed Nemo integration design.
