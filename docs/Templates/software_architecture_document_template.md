rectangle "External System 1" as ES1
rectangle "External System 2" as ES2
rectangle "External System 3" as ES3

package "System" {
  [System Component]

@startuml
' Example sequence diagram - replace with actual sequence
actor User
participant "Process 1" as P1
participant "Process 2" as P2
participant "Process 3" as P3

User -> P1: request()
activate P1
P1 -> P2: process()
activate P2
P2 -> P3: getData()
activate P3
P3 --> P2: return data
deactivate P3
P2 --> P1: return result
deactivate P2
P1 --> User: display result
deactivate P1
