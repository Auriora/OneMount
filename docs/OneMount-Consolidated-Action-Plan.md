## ðŸ¤– AI IMPLEMENTATION PROMPTS

For each priority task, use these specific prompts with your AI assistant:

### Priority 1: Documentation Consolidation Prompts âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Planning Prompt**:
```
Review all documentation in the OneMount docs/ folder. Identify:
1. Overlapping or redundant information across multiple files
2. Outdated status indicators that don't match current implementation
3. Multiple implementation plans that should be consolidated
4. Missing cross-references or broken links
Create a consolidation plan that eliminates redundancy while preserving important information.
```

**Implementation Prompt**:
```
Consolidate the OneMount project documentation by:
1. Merging overlapping implementation plans into a single source of truth
2. Updating all status indicators to reflect current reality (many issues are now closed)
3. Creating a clear hierarchy: current status â†’ immediate priorities â†’ deferred features
4. Removing or archiving outdated documents
5. Ensuring all documentation follows the Solo Developer AI Process principles
Focus on creating actionable, concise documentation that eliminates ceremony while maintaining quality.
```

### Priority 2: Testing Implementation Prompts

**Planning Prompt**:
```
Analyze the OneMount test suite to increase coverage from 57.6% to 80%. Focus on:
1. Critical filesystem operations that lack comprehensive testing
2. Error conditions and edge cases in network operations
3. Concurrency scenarios and race conditions
4. Integration tests for offline functionality
Prioritize tests that provide the highest confidence in core functionality.
```

**Implementation Prompt**:
```
Implement comprehensive table-driven unit tests for OneMount focusing on:
1. Core filesystem operations (read, write, delete, rename, metadata)
2. Error handling scenarios (network failures, permission errors, disk space)
3. Concurrency testing (multiple simultaneous operations, race conditions)
4. Offline functionality integration tests
Use Go's testing package with sub-tests (t.Run) and proper mocking for external dependencies.
Ensure tests are deterministic and can run reliably in CI/CD environments.
```

### Priority 3: Architecture Implementation Prompts

**Planning Prompt**:
```
Review the OneMount project structure and plan architectural improvements:
1. Analyze the current 677-line main.go file and identify discrete services
2. Plan migration to standard Go project layout (internal/ and pkg/ directories)
3. Design dependency injection for external clients (Graph API, database)
4. Ensure changes improve testability without breaking existing functionality
Create a phased approach that minimizes risk while improving code organization.
```

**Implementation Prompt**:
```
Refactor OneMount architecture following Go best practices:
1. Extract services from main.go: CLI handling, filesystem service, statistics service, daemon handling
2. Organize code into internal/ (private packages) and pkg/ (public libraries)
3. Implement dependency injection for Graph API and database clients
4. Maintain backward compatibility while improving testability
5. Follow the principle of minimal viable changes - improve structure without over-engineering
Ensure all existing tests continue to pass after refactoring.
```

### Priority 4: Documentation Enhancement Prompts

**Planning Prompt**:
```
Review OneMount documentation for user and developer experience improvements:
1. Assess README.md for missing table of contents and contribution guidelines
2. Evaluate docs/DEVELOPMENT.md for architectural overview gaps
3. Identify missing test framework documentation and examples
4. Plan API documentation for test framework components
Focus on documentation that directly helps users and contributors be successful.
```

**Implementation Prompt**:
```
Enhance OneMount documentation for better user and developer experience:
1. Add comprehensive table of contents and contribution guidelines to README.md
2. Create architectural overview in docs/DEVELOPMENT.md showing system components
3. Document test framework architecture with practical examples
4. Create API documentation for test framework components
5. Add templates and examples for different types of tests
6. Ensure documentation follows the Solo Developer AI Process - concise, actionable, focused on outcomes
Make documentation that enables quick onboarding and effective contribution.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS

1. **Start with Priority 2** (Testing Recommendations Implementation) - use the AI prompts provided
2. **Use the AI prompts exactly as written** - they're designed for the Solo Developer AI Process
3. **Complete each priority fully before moving to the next** - avoid context switching
4. **Verify each phase thoroughly** - catch issues early when they're easier to fix
5. **Update this document as you progress** - keep it as the single source of truth

This consolidated action plan replaces all previous implementation plans and status documents. It follows the Solo Developer AI Process principles of minimizing overhead while maximizing AI leverage and focusing on outcomes.
