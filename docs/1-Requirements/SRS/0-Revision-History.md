## Using This Document

The revision history helps track the evolution of the SRS document over time. When making changes to the SRS:

1. **Update the revision history**: Add a new entry to the table above with:
   - An incremented version number (major.minor.patch)
   - The date of the change
   - A brief description of the change
   - The name or identifier of the person making the change

2. **Version numbering convention**:
   - Major version (1.x.x): Significant structural changes or major feature additions
   - Minor version (x.1.x): New sections or substantial content additions
   - Patch version (x.x.1): Minor corrections, clarifications, or formatting changes

3. **Change descriptions**: Keep descriptions concise but informative, focusing on what was changed rather than why it was changed.
