# OneMount Release Strategy

## Project Status Summary

The OneMount project has made significant progress with the completion of Phase 1 (Critical Issues) but requires focused work on core functionality before it's ready for a stable release. The project has a solid foundation with completed work on resource management, error handling framework, and concurrency control, but needs enhancement in several key areas.

### Strengths
- ✅ Solid foundation with completed Phase 1 critical issues
- ✅ Well-organized project structure and documentation framework
- ✅ Clear implementation plan with prioritized issues
- ✅ Basic functionality for core features is implemented

### Areas Needing Attention
- ⚠️ Core functionality enhancements (offline mode, error recovery)
- ⚠️ Testing infrastructure and coverage
- ⚠️ Implementation documentation gaps
- ⚠️ Stub code and partial implementations

## Release Strategy

### 1. Focus on Core Functionality First

The most critical path to a stable release involves completing three key features:

1. **Error Handling (Issue #68)**
   - This is a dependency for other important features
   - Already has a solid foundation with standardized error handling (Issue #59)

2. **Offline Functionality (Issue #67)**
   - Basic implementation exists but needs enhancement
   - Critical for user experience with unreliable networks

3. **Error Recovery for Uploads/Downloads (Issue #15)**
   - Essential for a reliable filesystem
   - Depends on improved error handling

### 2. Implement "Just Enough" Testing

Rather than aiming for comprehensive test coverage immediately:

1. Focus on testing critical paths and error conditions
2. Implement essential test utilities (Issue #109)
3. Target 70% coverage of core functionality
4. Defer comprehensive testing to post-release

### 3. Clean Up as You Go

Address project "noise" during the implementation of core features:

1. Either complete or remove stub implementations
2. Update documentation to match actual implementation
3. Mark incomplete features clearly
4. Create a "deferred features" document

### 4. Defer Non-Essential Improvements

Several planned improvements can be deferred to post-release:

1. Architecture improvements (Issues #54, #55, #53)
2. Advanced features (UI improvements, integrations)
3. Performance optimizations
4. Comprehensive documentation updates

## Timeline and Milestones

### Milestone 1: Release Criteria (1 week)
- Define specific criteria for a stable release
- Create a checklist of must-have features
- Get stakeholder agreement

### Milestone 2: Core Functionality (3-4 weeks)
- Complete error handling enhancements
- Enhance offline functionality
- Implement basic error recovery

### Milestone 3: Testing and Stabilization (2-3 weeks)
- Implement critical test utilities
- Increase test coverage of core functionality
- Fix issues identified during testing

### Milestone 4: Release Preparation (1-2 weeks)
- Finalize user documentation
- Create release notes
- Prepare distribution packages

## Measuring Success

The success of this release strategy will be measured by:

1. **Functionality Completeness**
   - All critical path features implemented
   - Core functionality works reliably

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - Test coverage of core functionality ≥ 70%
   - No critical bugs in core functionality
   - Successful offline-to-online transitions

3. **Documentation Accuracy**
   - Documentation matches implemented features
   - Clear indication of what's implemented vs. planned

## Conclusion

This release strategy prioritizes delivering a stable, reliable core product over implementing all planned features. By focusing on the most critical functionality first and deferring non-essential improvements, OneMount can achieve a stable release in a reasonable timeframe.

The strategy acknowledges the current state of the project and provides a pragmatic approach to moving forward, with clear priorities and measurable milestones. By following this strategy, the project can deliver a valuable product to users while establishing a solid foundation for future enhancements.
