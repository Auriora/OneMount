### 3.3 Implementation Prompts

117. **Redesign Upload API for Robust Session Handling**
     - Implement a solution to redesign the Upload API, making it more robust by enhancing the `WaitForUpload` method

     ```
     # Junie Prompt: Redesign Upload API for Robust Session Handling

     ## Task Overview
     Implement Solution 5 from the race condition analysis to redesign the Upload API, making it more robust by enhancing the `WaitForUpload` method to handle cases where a session hasn't been added to the sessions map yet.

     ## Current Issue
     There's a race condition in the `UploadManager` between queuing an upload and waiting for it. The `WaitForUpload` method checks if the upload session exists in the `sessions` map, but this map is only populated when the session is processed by the `uploadLoop`, which runs on a ticker. This causes test failures when `WaitForUpload` is called immediately after `QueueUploadWithPriority`.

     ## Proposed Changes

     ### 1. Requirements Impact Analysis
     - No changes to the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) are needed
     - This change improves the robustness of the API without changing its functional requirements
     - The change maintains backward compatibility with existing code
     - The change addresses a race condition that could affect reliability in production environments

     ### 2. Architecture Document Changes
     Add the following to the architecture document:

     ```
     #### Upload Manager Session Handling
     The UploadManager now includes enhanced session handling to prevent race conditions between queuing uploads and waiting for them to complete. The `WaitForUpload` method has been improved to handle cases where a session hasn't been processed by the upload loop yet, making the API more resilient to timing issues.
     ```

     ### 3. Design Documentation Changes
     Update the design documentation with:

     ```
     #### Upload API Robustness Improvements
     The Upload API has been enhanced to handle race conditions between session creation and waiting:

     1. `WaitForUpload` now includes a waiting period for session creation
     2. A new helper method `GetSession` provides thread-safe access to session information
     3. Timeout mechanisms prevent indefinite waiting for sessions that may never be created
     4. Error messages are more descriptive to help diagnose issues
     ```

     ### 4. Implementation Details

     Modify `upload_manager.go` to include:

     1. Add a new `GetSession` method:

     ```
     // GetSession returns the upload session for the given ID if it exists
     func (u *UploadManager) GetSession(id string) (*UploadSession, bool) {
         u.mutex.RLock()
         defer u.mutex.RUnlock()
         session, exists := u.sessions[id]
         return session, exists
     }
     ```

     2. Enhance the `WaitForUpload` method:

     ```
     // WaitForUpload waits for an upload to complete
     func (u *UploadManager) WaitForUpload(id string) error {
         // First, check if the session exists
         _, exists := u.GetSession(id)
         if !exists {
             // If not, wait for it to be created (with timeout)
             deadline := time.Now().Add(5 * time.Second)
             for time.Now().Before(deadline) {
                 _, exists := u.GetSession(id)
                 if exists {
                     break
                 }
                 time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)
             }

             // Final check after waiting
             _, exists := u.GetSession(id)
             if !exists {
                 return errors.New("upload session not found: Failed to wait for upload")
             }
         }

         // Now wait for the upload to complete
         for {
             session, exists := u.GetSession(id)
             if !exists {
                 return errors.New("upload session disappeared during wait")
             }

             state := session.getState()
             switch state {
             case uploadComplete:
                 return nil
             case uploadErrored:
                 return session.error
             default:
                 // Still in progress, wait a bit
                 time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
             }
         }
     }
     ```

     ### 5. Refactoring Dependent Code
     No changes to dependent code are required as this implementation maintains the same API signature and behavior, only making it more robust.

     ### 6. Testing Strategy

     #### Unit Tests
     1. Test `WaitForUpload` with a session that already exists
     2. Test `WaitForUpload` with a session that doesn't exist yet but is added shortly after
     3. Test `WaitForUpload` with a session that is never added (should timeout)
     4. Test `WaitForUpload` with a session that is removed during waiting

     ```
     func TestWaitForUpload_SessionAlreadyExists(t *testing.T) {
         // Setup test with a session already in the sessions map
         // Call WaitForUpload
         // Verify it waits correctly for completion
     }

     func TestWaitForUpload_SessionAddedLater(t *testing.T) {
         // Setup test
         // Start a goroutine that adds the session after a short delay
         // Call WaitForUpload
         // Verify it waits for the session to be added and then for completion
     }

     func TestWaitForUpload_SessionNeverAdded(t *testing.T) {
         // Setup test
         // Call WaitForUpload with an ID that will never be added
         // Verify it times out with the correct error message
     }

     func TestWaitForUpload_SessionDisappearsDuringWait(t *testing.T) {
         // Setup test with a session in the sessions map
         // Start a goroutine that removes the session after a short delay
         // Call WaitForUpload
         // Verify it returns the correct error
     }
     ```

     #### Integration Tests
     1. Fix the existing `TestUT_FS_05_02_RepeatedUploads_OnlineMode_SuccessfulUpload` test without adding delays
     2. Add a stress test that rapidly queues and waits for multiple uploads

     ```
     func TestStressUploadQueueAndWait(t *testing.T) {
         // Setup test
         // Queue multiple uploads in rapid succession
         // Wait for all of them to complete
         // Verify all completed successfully
     }
     ```

     ### 7. Implementation Considerations
     - The timeout value (5 seconds) should be configurable or at least carefully chosen
     - Error messages should be descriptive to help diagnose issues
     - Consider adding logging to help debug timing issues
     - The implementation should be thread-safe and handle concurrent calls to `WaitForUpload`

     ### 8. Backward Compatibility
     This change maintains backward compatibility with existing code that uses `WaitForUpload`, as it only adds functionality without changing the method signature or expected behavior.

     ## Expected Outcome
     After implementing these changes:
     1. The race condition in tests will be resolved without adding unreliable delays
     2. The API will be more robust for all users, not just in tests
     3. Error messages will be more descriptive
     4. The code will handle edge cases more gracefully

     ## Acceptance Criteria
     1. All existing tests pass without modifications
     2. New tests for the enhanced functionality pass
     3. No regression in performance or functionality
     4. Code review confirms thread safety and proper error handling
     ```

     4. `CreateTempFile(t *testing.T, dir, prefix string, content []byte) string` - Creates a temporary file with the given content and ensures it's cleaned up after the test
     5. `FileExists(path string) bool` - Checks if a file exists at the given path
     6. `FileContains(path string, expected []byte) (bool, error)` - Checks if a file contains the expected content
     7. `AssertFileExists(t *testing.T, path string)` - Asserts that a file exists at the given path

     Each function should be properly documented with godoc comments and include appropriate error handling. The functions should integrate with the TestFramework for automatic cleanup of resources.
     ```

119. **Implement Asynchronous Utilities**
     - Create a set of asynchronous utilities in a dedicated `async.go` file

     ```
     I need to implement asynchronous utilities for testing in the OneMount project. Please create a new file at `internal/testutil/helpers/async.go` that includes the following functions:

     1. `WaitForCondition(t *testing.T, condition func() bool, timeout, interval time.Duration, message string) error` - Waits for a condition to be true with a configurable timeout and polling interval

     6. `WaitForFileChange(t *testing.T, path string, timeout, interval time.Duration) error` - Waits for a file to change (by checking its modification time)
     7. `WaitForFileExistence(t *testing.T, path string, shouldExist bool, timeout, interval time.Duration) error` - Waits for a file to exist or not exist

     Each function should be properly documented with godoc comments and include appropriate error handling. The functions should be designed to work with the TestFramework and use the context provided by it when appropriate.
     ```

120. **Implement Dmelfa Generator**
     - Create a utility for generating large test files with random DNA sequence data

     ```
     I need to implement a utility for generating large test files with random DNA sequence data for the OneMount project. Please create a new file at `internal/testutil/helpers/dmelfa_generator.go` that includes the following functions:

     1. `GenerateDmelfa(path string, size int64) error` - Generates a dmel.fa file with random DNA sequence data of the specified size if it doesn't exist
     2. `EnsureDmelfaExists() error` - Ensures that the dmel.fa file exists at the path specified in `testutil.DmelfaDir` before tests run, generating it if necessary

     The generator should create a file with a format similar to a FASTA file, with header lines starting with '>' followed by sequence identifier information, and sequence lines containing DNA sequences (A, C, G, T). The file should be large enough to test performance with large files (at least 100MB by default).

     Each function should be properly documented with godoc comments and include appropriate error handling. The functions should be designed to work with the TestFramework and be integrated as a test resource.
     ```

121. **Enhance Graph API Test Fixtures**
     - Extend the existing `mock_graph.go` file to include more comprehensive fixture creation utilities

     ```

     8. `CreateDriveItemWithConflict(name string, conflictBehavior string) *graph.DriveItem` - Creates a DriveItem fixture with conflict behavior set

     Each function should be properly documented with godoc comments. The functions should be designed to work with the existing MockGraphProvider and be used to create consistent test data.
     ```

122. **Integrate with TestFramework**
     - Ensure all new utilities are integrated with the existing TestFramework and IntegrationTestEnvironment classes

     ```
     I need to integrate the newly created test utilities with the existing TestFramework and IntegrationTestEnvironment classes in the OneMount project. Please create a new file at `internal/testutil/framework/integration.go` that includes the following functions:

     Also, please update the `NewTestFramework` function in `internal/testutil/framework/framework.go` to call these registration functions, ensuring that all new utilities are available by default when creating a new TestFramework.

     Each function should be properly documented with godoc comments. The integration should ensure that:
     - File utilities register created resources with the TestFramework for automatic cleanup
     - Asynchronous utilities use the context provided by the TestFramework
     - The Dmelfa generator is integrated as a test resource
     - Graph API fixtures can be used with the existing MockGraphProvider
     ```

123. **Create Comprehensive Documentation**
     - Update the test utilities documentation to include the new utilities and provide examples of their usage

     ```
     I need to update the test utilities documentation in the OneMount project to include the newly added utilities. Please update the file at `docs/testing/test-utilities.md` to include the following sections:

     Each section should include:
     - A brief overview of the utility's purpose
     - A description of each function and its parameters
     - Example code showing how to use the utility in tests
     - Best practices for using the utility

     The documentation should be clear, concise, and follow the same style as the existing documentation.
     ```

124. **Create Example Tests**
     - Create example tests that demonstrate the usage of the new utilities

     ```
     I need to create example tests that demonstrate the usage of the newly added test utilities in the OneMount project. Please create a new file at `internal/testutil/examples/examples_test.go` that includes the following test functions:

     1. `TestFileUtilitiesExample` - Demonstrates the usage of file utilities
     2. `TestAsyncUtilitiesExample` - Demonstrates the usage of asynchronous utilities
     3. `TestDmelfaGeneratorExample` - Demonstrates the usage of the Dmelfa generator
     4. `TestGraphFixturesExample` - Demonstrates the usage of Graph API fixtures
