The test is failing with multiple errors related to file uploads. Let me analyze each issue:

## 1. "upload session not found: Failed to wait for upload"

This error occurs at line 148 in `upload_manager_test.go` when calling `WaitForUpload(fileID)`. The `WaitForUpload` method checks if a session exists for the given ID, and returns an error if it doesn't.

The issue is likely that the upload session is being removed from the `sessions` map before `WaitForUpload` is called, or it's not being properly added to the map in the first place.

## 2. "could not unmarshal response: invalid character 'r' looking for beginning of value: remote file content"

This error occurs at lines 185 and 220 during the upload process. It happens in the `Upload` method when trying to unmarshal the response from the server.

The error suggests that the response is not valid JSON, possibly starting with the character 'r'. This typically happens when:
- The mock client is returning a string or other non-JSON response
- The response contains raw text instead of JSON
- There's an error in the mock response format

## 3. File Size Mismatches

There are two file size mismatch errors:
- "Expected 16, but got 15: File size mismatch" (line 191)
- "Expected 13, but got 15: File size mismatch" (line 226)

The test expects the file size to be:
- 16 bytes for "modified content" 
- 13 bytes for "final content"

But it's getting 15 bytes in both cases, suggesting that the file content is not being updated correctly during the upload process.

## Root Causes and Solutions

1. **Mock Response Issue**: The mock client is likely not properly handling the upload responses. When the test calls `mockClient.AddMockItem("/me/drive/items/"+fileID, fileItem)`, it's setting up a response for GET requests, but not properly handling the PUT requests for uploads.

2. **Upload Session Management**: The upload manager is not properly tracking the upload sessions, causing the "session not found" error.

3. **Content Size Discrepancy**: The file size is consistently 15 bytes, which suggests that some default or cached content is being used instead of the actual updated content.

## Recommended Fixes:

1. **Fix Mock Upload Response**:
   ```go
   // Add proper mock response for the upload endpoint
   mockClient.AddMockResponse("/me/drive/items/"+fileID+"/content", []byte(fileItemJSON), 200, nil)
   ```

2. **Ensure Upload Session Persistence**:
   - Check that the upload session is being properly added to the sessions map
   - Verify that the session isn't being prematurely removed

3. **Fix Content Size Issue**:
   - Ensure that the mock client is returning the correct file size after upload
   - Verify that the file content is being properly updated in the mock responses

4. **Add Debug Logging**:
   - Add temporary logging to track the upload session lifecycle
   - Log the actual content size and expected size at each step

By addressing these issues, the test should be able to successfully verify that files can be uploaded multiple times with different content in online mode.
