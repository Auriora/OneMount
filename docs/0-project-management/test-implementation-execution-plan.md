3. **Graph API Test Fixtures** depend on **Basic Mock Providers**
4. **Specialized Framework Extensions** in Phase 3 depend on the core framework from Phase 1
5. **Integration Test Environment** depends on the mock infrastructure from Phase 2
6. **Advanced Features** in Phase 4 depend on the framework features from Phase 3
7. **Documentation** in Phase 5 depends on the implementation of the features it documents

The implementation plan assumes the following resource allocation:

1. **Core Framework Developer**: Responsible for implementing the core framework features in Phases 1 and 3
2. **Mock Infrastructure Developer**: Responsible for implementing the mock infrastructure in Phase 2
3. **Test Utilities Developer**: Responsible for implementing the test utilities in Phases 2 and 4
4. **Documentation Specialist**: Responsible for creating documentation and training materials in Phase 5

## Success Criteria and Metrics

The success of the implementation plan will be measured by the following criteria:

1. **Test Reliability**: Reduction in flaky tests and test failures due to environment issues
2. **Test Coverage**: Increase in test coverage across the codebase
3. **Test Efficiency**: Reduction in test execution time and resource usage
4. **Developer Productivity**: Reduction in time spent writing and maintaining tests

## Risk Management

The implementation plan includes the following risk management strategies:

1. **Phased Approach**: The phased approach allows for early feedback and course correction
2. **Prioritization**: High-priority tasks are scheduled early to ensure they are completed
3. **Parallel Development**: Parallel development opportunities allow for efficient use of resources
4. **Dependencies Management**: Dependencies between tasks are identified and managed
5. **Success Criteria**: Clear success criteria allow for objective evaluation of progress
