# OneMount Deferred Features

This document lists features and improvements that should be deferred to post-initial release. These items are tracked in the project's issue system but are not considered essential for the first stable release.

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Refactor main.go into Discrete Services (Issue #54)
- **Description**: Break down large main.go routines into discrete services
- **Rationale for Deferral**: The current architecture, while not ideal, is functional and stable enough for an initial release
- **Target Release**: v1.1

### 2. Introduce Dependency Injection for External Clients (Issue #55)
- **Description**: Implement dependency injection for external dependencies
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Depends on Issue #54; architectural improvement that doesn't directly impact core functionality
- **Target Release**: v1.1

### 3. Adopt Standard Go Project Layout (Issue #53)
- **Description**: Reorganize the project to follow standard Go project layout
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Major structural change that risks introducing bugs; current structure is functional
- **Target Release**: v1.2

## UI Improvements

### 1. UI Improvements (Issues #26, #25, #24, #22)
- **Description**: Various improvements to the user interface
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Core functionality takes precedence over UI enhancements
- **Target Release**: v1.1

## Advanced Features

### 1. Advanced Features (Issues #41, #40, #39, #38, #37)
- **Description**: Various advanced features beyond core functionality
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Not essential for basic filesystem functionality
- **Target Release**: v1.2 and beyond

### 2. Integration with Other Systems (Issues #44, #43, #42)
- **Description**: Integration with external systems and services
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Not essential for core functionality
- **Target Release**: v1.2 and beyond

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Performance Optimizations (Issues #11, #10, #9, #8, #7)
- **Description**: Various performance improvements
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Basic performance is acceptable; optimizations can come later
- **Target Release**: v1.1 and beyond

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Security Enhancements (Issues #21, #19, #18, #17)
- **Description**: Additional security features beyond basic authentication
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Basic security is in place; enhancements can come later
- **Target Release**: v1.1

## Statistics and Monitoring

### 1. Statistics and Monitoring (Issues #75, #74, #73, #72, #71, #65)
- **Description**: Advanced statistics collection and monitoring capabilities
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Basic logging and error reporting is sufficient for initial release
- **Target Release**: v1.2

## Comprehensive Documentation

### 1. Design Documentation (Issues #96, #95, #94, #93, #92, #91, #90, #89, #88, #87, #86, #84, #83, #82, #81, #80, #79, #78, #77, #76)
- **Description**: Comprehensive design documentation beyond what's needed for development
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Focus on user and developer documentation for initial release
- **Target Release**: Ongoing

## Testing Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Testing Features (Issues #110, #112, #114)
- **Description**: Advanced testing utilities and frameworks
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Basic testing infrastructure is sufficient for initial release
- **Target Release**: v1.1

## Packaging and Deployment

### 1. Advanced Packaging and Deployment (Issues #50, #49, #48, #47)
- **Description**: Advanced packaging and deployment options
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Basic installation methods are sufficient for initial release
- **Target Release**: v1.1

## Managing Deferred Features

### Communication
- Clearly communicate to users which features are included in the initial release and which are planned for future releases
- Update the roadmap to reflect the deferred features and their target releases

### Tracking
- Keep the issues for deferred features open in the issue tracker
- Tag them with "deferred-v1.0" to indicate they're intentionally deferred
- Review deferred features regularly to reassess their priority

### Documentation
- Document any workarounds or limitations due to deferred features
- Include information about planned improvements in release notes

## Conclusion

By deferring these features, the team can focus on delivering a stable, reliable core product in the initial release. These deferred features provide a roadmap for future development and will be prioritized for subsequent releases based on user feedback and business needs.

The decision to defer these features is based on a careful assessment of what's essential for a functional filesystem versus what would be nice to have. This approach allows for faster delivery of a useful product while establishing a clear path for future enhancements.
