## Conclusion

This action plan focuses on completing the core functionality needed for a stable release while deferring non-essential improvements. By following this plan, the team can deliver a reliable product with well-tested core features in a reasonable timeframe.

The most critical areas to address are error handling, offline functionality, and error recovery for uploads/downloads. These features form the foundation of a reliable filesystem and should be prioritized above all else.

Progress should be reviewed weekly, and the plan adjusted as needed based on findings and challenges encountered during implementation.
