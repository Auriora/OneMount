# Error Handling Monitoring and Refinement Plan

This document outlines a plan for monitoring and refining the standardized error handling approach in the OneMount project based on real-world usage.

## Collecting Developer Feedback

1. **Regular Code Reviews**
   - Designate reviewers to specifically check for proper error handling
   - Create a checklist for error handling best practices
   - Provide constructive feedback on error handling patterns

2. **Developer Surveys**
   - Conduct quarterly surveys to gather feedback on error handling patterns
   - Ask about pain points and areas for improvement
   - Collect suggestions for additional error types or utilities

3. **Error Handling Workshops**
   - Organize monthly workshops to discuss error handling challenges
   - Review real-world examples from the codebase
   - Brainstorm solutions to common error handling problems

4. **Monitoring Error Logs**
   - Analyze production error logs to identify common error patterns
   - Look for areas where error context could be improved
   - Track error frequency and severity to prioritize improvements

## Identifying Additional Error Types

1. **Error Pattern Analysis**
   - Review existing error handling code to identify common patterns
   - Look for repeated error wrapping or custom error types
   - Consider standardizing these patterns into specialized error types

2. **Domain-Specific Error Types**
   - Identify domain-specific error conditions in each module
   - Create specialized error types for these conditions
   - Document when and how to use these error types

3. **Error Categorization**
   - Categorize errors by their source (network, filesystem, authentication, etc.)
   - Create error types for each category
   - Implement helper functions for creating and checking these error types

4. **Error Severity Levels**
   - Define severity levels for errors (critical, major, minor, etc.)
   - Add severity information to error types
   - Use severity to determine appropriate logging and handling

## Refining Documentation

1. **Living Documentation**
   - Keep error handling documentation up to date with new patterns
   - Add examples of real-world error handling from the codebase
   - Update based on developer feedback and questions

2. **Error Handling Cheat Sheet**
   - Create a one-page cheat sheet for common error handling patterns
   - Include examples of creating, wrapping, and checking errors
   - Distribute to all developers and include in onboarding materials

3. **Error Handling FAQ**
   - Maintain a FAQ document for common error handling questions
   - Update based on questions from developers
   - Include examples of correct and incorrect error handling

4. **Code Examples Repository**
   - Create a repository of error handling code examples
   - Include examples for different scenarios and modules
   - Use real-world examples from the codebase

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Month 1: Initial Monitoring**
   - Set up error log analysis
   - Create initial developer survey
   - Establish code review checklist

2. **Month 2: Feedback Collection**
   - Conduct first developer survey
   - Organize first error handling workshop
   - Begin analyzing error logs

3. **Month 3: Initial Refinements**
   - Identify additional error types based on feedback
   - Update documentation with new patterns
   - Create error handling cheat sheet

4. **Month 4-6: Continuous Improvement**
   - Implement additional error types
   - Refine documentation based on feedback
   - Conduct follow-up surveys and workshops

## Success Metrics

1. **Developer Satisfaction**
   - Measure developer satisfaction with error handling through surveys
   - Track improvement over time

2. **Error Handling Consistency**
   - Measure consistency of error handling patterns through code reviews
   - Track reduction in inconsistent patterns

3. **Error Resolution Time**
   - Measure time to resolve errors in production
   - Track improvement as error context improves

4. **Documentation Usage**
   - Track usage of error handling documentation
   - Measure reduction in questions about error handling

## Conclusion

By implementing this monitoring and refinement plan, we can ensure that our standardized error handling approach continues to evolve and improve based on real-world usage. This will lead to more consistent, maintainable, and debuggable code across the OneMount project.
