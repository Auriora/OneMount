> **Template Guide**
> 1. Replace "XXX" in the Use Case ID with a 2-3 letter code for the functional area (e.g., "AUTH" for Authentication, "PROC" for Processing)
> 2. Replace "[Use Case Name]" with a descriptive name for the use case
> 3. Fill in all fields with appropriate content for your use case
> 4. For the Main Flow and Alternative Flows, provide step-by-step descriptions of the interactions
> 5. Link to related functional and non-functional requirements using the appropriate IDs
> 6. Add or modify fields as needed for your specific project
> 7. Remove this note when done
