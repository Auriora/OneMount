# 7. Requirements Prioritization Matrix

This section provides a comprehensive framework for prioritizing requirements based on their importance, complexity, and value. As a solo developer with AI assistance, this matrix will help you make informed decisions about what to implement and in what order.

## How to Use This Matrix

1. **List all requirements** in the table below, using their unique IDs
2. **Assign a MoSCoW priority** to each requirement:
   - **Must Have**: Critical requirements without which the system will not function
   - **Should Have**: Important requirements that should be included if possible
   - **Could Have**: Desirable requirements that can be omitted if necessary
   - **Won't Have**: Requirements that will not be implemented in the current version
3. **Rate the complexity** of implementing each requirement on a scale of 1-5:
   - **1**: Very simple, can be implemented quickly with minimal effort
   - **2**: Simple, requires moderate effort but no significant challenges
   - **3**: Moderate, requires significant effort but is well understood
   - **4**: Complex, requires substantial effort and may involve technical challenges
   - **5**: Very complex, requires extensive effort and involves significant technical challenges
4. **Rate the value** of each requirement on a scale of 1-5:
   - **1**: Minimal value, nice to have but not essential
   - **2**: Low value, provides some benefit to users
   - **3**: Moderate value, provides significant benefit to users
   - **4**: High value, provides substantial benefit to users
   - **5**: Critical value, essential for meeting user needs
5. **Calculate the Value/Complexity Ratio** (optional but helpful):
   - Divide the Value rating by the Complexity rating
   - Higher ratios indicate better "bang for your buck"
6. **Determine the implementation order** based on:
   - MoSCoW priority (implement "Must Have" items first)
   - Value/Complexity ratio (higher ratios should generally be implemented earlier)
   - Dependencies between requirements
7. **Document your rationale** for prioritization decisions

## Implementation Strategy

Based on the prioritization matrix, the implementation strategy for onedriver should follow these principles:

1. **Core Filesystem Functionality First**: Implement the basic filesystem mounting and operations (FR-FS-001, FR-FS-002, FR-FS-003) as the foundation.

2. **Authentication and Security Early**: Implement authentication (FR-AUTH-001, FR-AUTH-002) and security measures (NFR-SEC-001, NFR-SEC-002, NFR-SEC-003) early to ensure secure access.

3. **On-demand File Access**: Implement on-demand file downloading (FR-FS-004) as a key differentiator.

4. **Performance Optimizations**: Implement caching (FR-FS-005) and performance requirements (NFR-PERF-001, NFR-PERF-003, NFR-PERF-004) to ensure good user experience.

5. **Offline Functionality**: Implement offline access (FR-OFF-001, FR-OFF-002) after core functionality is stable.

6. **User Interface**: Implement CLI (FR-UI-001) first, followed by GUI (FR-UI-002) and status information (FR-UI-003).

7. **Advanced Features**: Implement conflict handling (FR-FS-006), offline synchronization (FR-OFF-004), and other advanced features after core functionality is stable.

8. **Maintainability**: Address maintainability requirements (NFR-MNT-001, NFR-MNT-002, NFR-MNT-003, NFR-MNT-004) throughout the development process.
