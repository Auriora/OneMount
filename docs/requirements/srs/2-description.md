# 2. Overall Description

This section provides a high-level overview of the OneMount system, its context, and major functions.

## 2.1 Product Perspective
OneMount is a native Linux filesystem implementation for Microsoft OneDrive that integrates with the Linux operating system using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace). It serves as a bridge between the local Linux filesystem and Microsoft's OneDrive cloud storage service.

Unlike traditional sync clients that download all files to local storage, OneMount performs on-demand file downloads, saving local storage space. It integrates with the Microsoft Graph API to access OneDrive resources and uses local caching to improve performance and enable offline functionality.

OneMount fits into the ecosystem of cloud storage solutions for Linux, providing a native filesystem approach rather than a sync-based approach. It complements the Microsoft OneDrive service by providing Linux users with direct filesystem access to their OneDrive content.

## 2.2 Product Functions
OneMount provides the following major functions:

1. **OneDrive Filesystem Mounting**: Mounts OneDrive as a native Linux filesystem using FUSE
2. **On-demand File Access**: Downloads files only when accessed, rather than syncing everything
3. **File Operations**: Supports standard file operations (read, write, create, delete, rename)
4. **Directory Operations**: Supports standard directory operations (list, create, delete, rename)
5. **Authentication**: Handles Microsoft account authentication and token management
6. **Offline Mode**: Provides access to previously accessed files when offline
7. **Caching**: Caches file metadata and content to improve performance
8. **GUI Launcher**: Provides a graphical interface for mounting and configuration
9. **Conflict Resolution**: Handles file conflicts between local and remote changes
10. **Error Handling**: Manages network errors and retries
11. **Enhanced Statistics**: Provides detailed metadata analysis of OneDrive content
12. **D-Bus Interface**: Offers real-time file status updates through D-Bus
13. **Nemo Integration**: Integrates with the Nemo file manager for improved user experience
14. **Method Logging**: Provides comprehensive logging for debugging and analysis
15. **Developer Tools**: Includes method logging framework for debugging

## 2.3 Constraints
The following constraints apply to the OneMount system:

1. **Technical Constraints**:
   - Requires FUSE support in the Linux kernel
   - Depends on the Microsoft Graph API for OneDrive access
   - Written in Go, requiring Go compiler and dependencies
   - GTK3 dependency for the GUI components

2. **Performance Constraints**:
   - Network bandwidth and latency affect file access speed
   - Local cache size impacts offline functionality

3. **Security Constraints**:
   - Must securely store authentication tokens
   - Must handle user data with appropriate permissions

## 2.4 Assumptions
The following assumptions are made regarding the OneMount system:

1. Users have a Microsoft account with OneDrive access
2. The Linux system has FUSE installed and properly configured
3. The system has internet connectivity for initial setup and file access
4. Users understand the on-demand nature of file access (vs. full synchronization)
5. The Microsoft Graph API remains stable and backward compatible
6. Users have sufficient local storage for the cache
