# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for OneDriver

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the software requirements for OneDriver, a native Linux filesystem for Microsoft OneDrive that performs on-demand file downloads rather than syncing the entire OneDrive content.

### 1.2 Scope
This SRS focuses on the requirements for three core features of OneDriver:
1. File Synchronization
2. Authentication
3. Error Handling

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **FUSE**: Filesystem in Userspace - allows implementing a filesystem in user space
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **OAuth2**: Open Authorization 2.0 - an authorization protocol
- **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification
- **UI**: User Interface

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 File Synchronization Requirements

- ID: SRS-F01
- Description: The system shall download files from OneDrive only when they are accessed by the user.
- Rationale: On-demand downloading saves bandwidth and local storage space, especially for users with large OneDrive accounts.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Files appear in the filesystem listing without being downloaded
  - File content is downloaded only when opened or accessed
  - File metadata (name, size, modification time) is available without downloading the content

- ID: SRS-F02
- Description: The system shall upload modified files to OneDrive when they are saved or closed.
- Rationale: Ensures that user changes are synchronized to the cloud storage for backup and access from other devices.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Modified files are queued for upload when saved or closed
  - Upload status is tracked and visible to the user
  - Upload resumes automatically after network interruptions

- ID: SRS-F03
- Description: The system shall use delta synchronization to efficiently update the local filesystem with remote changes.
- Rationale: Delta synchronization minimizes bandwidth usage and improves performance by only transferring changes.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - System requests only changes since last synchronization
  - Only changed files and folders are updated locally
  - Synchronization completes in reasonable time proportional to the number of changes

- ID: SRS-F04
- Description: The system shall detect and resolve conflicts when the same file is modified both locally and remotely.
- Rationale: Conflict resolution prevents data loss and ensures consistency between local and remote storage.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Conflicts are detected during synchronization
  - User is notified of conflicts when they occur
  - System provides options to keep local version, remote version, or both

- ID: SRS-F05
- Description: The system shall support offline access to previously accessed files.
- Rationale: Offline access allows users to continue working even when network connectivity is unavailable.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Previously accessed files are available when offline
  - Changes made offline are tracked for later synchronization
  - System indicates which files are available offline

### 2.2 Authentication Requirements

- ID: SRS-F06
- Description: The system shall authenticate users using OAuth2 with Microsoft's identity platform.
- Rationale: OAuth2 provides secure, standardized authentication without storing user credentials locally.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Users are redirected to Microsoft's login page for authentication
  - System never stores user passwords
  - Authentication tokens are securely stored locally

- ID: SRS-F07
- Description: The system shall automatically refresh authentication tokens before they expire.
- Rationale: Automatic token refresh provides seamless user experience without requiring frequent re-authentication.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Tokens are refreshed before expiration
  - Refresh occurs without user intervention
  - System handles refresh failures gracefully

- ID: SRS-F08
- Description: The system shall provide both GUI and headless authentication methods.
- Rationale: Different authentication methods support various use cases, including servers without graphical interfaces.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - GUI authentication works on desktop environments
  - Headless authentication works on systems without a GUI
  - Both methods result in valid authentication tokens

- ID: SRS-F09
- Description: The system shall securely store authentication tokens on the local filesystem.
- Rationale: Secure storage prevents unauthorized access to user accounts.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Tokens are stored with appropriate file permissions
  - Tokens are not stored in plaintext in logs or other accessible locations
  - Token storage location is configurable

### 2.3 Error Handling Requirements

- ID: SRS-F10
- Description: The system shall handle network connectivity issues gracefully.
- Rationale: Robust error handling for network issues ensures the system remains usable even with unreliable connections.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - System detects network unavailability
  - Operations are queued for retry when connection is restored
  - User is notified of network status changes

- ID: SRS-F11
- Description: The system shall handle authentication failures with appropriate recovery mechanisms.
- Rationale: Authentication failure recovery prevents system lockout and provides clear paths to resolution.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - System detects authentication failures
  - System attempts to refresh tokens automatically
  - User is prompted to re-authenticate when necessary

- ID: SRS-F12
- Description: The system shall provide detailed error logging for troubleshooting.
- Rationale: Detailed logs help users and developers diagnose and fix issues.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Errors are logged with timestamps and context
  - Log levels are configurable
  - Logs do not contain sensitive information

- ID: SRS-F13
- Description: The system shall handle API rate limiting and quota exceeded errors.
- Rationale: Proper handling of service limitations prevents system failures and provides clear user feedback.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - System detects rate limiting and quota errors
  - Operations are retried with appropriate backoff
  - User is notified of quota limitations

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance Requirements

- ID: SRS-NF01
- Description: The system shall minimize local storage usage by downloading files on-demand.
- Rationale: Storage efficiency is critical for users with large OneDrive accounts and limited local storage.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Local storage usage is proportional to accessed files, not total OneDrive size
  - System provides options to clear cache and free space
  - Metadata storage is optimized for minimal footprint

- ID: SRS-NF02
