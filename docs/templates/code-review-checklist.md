# OneMount Code Review Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for reviewing code contributions to the OneMount project.

## Code Style and Conventions

### Go Code Style
- [ ] Code follows Go's official style guide and conventions
- [ ] `gofmt` or `goimports` has been run on all Go files
- [ ] Variable and function names use camelCase (or PascalCase for exported items)
- [ ] Packages have meaningful, concise names
- [ ] Comments are present for exported functions, types, and packages
- [ ] Line length is reasonable (< 100 characters when possible)
- [ ] No unnecessary comments or commented-out code

### Error Handling
- [ ] Errors are properly checked and handled
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Custom error types are used where appropriate
- [ ] No panics in library code (except for truly unrecoverable situations)
- [ ] Logging uses the project's standard logging framework (zerolog)

### Code Organization
- [ ] Functions have a single responsibility
- [ ] Functions are reasonably sized (< 50 lines when possible)
- [ ] Related functionality is grouped together
- [ ] Proper use of interfaces for decoupling
- [ ] No circular dependencies between packages

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Efficient algorithms and data structures are used
- [ ] Unnecessary memory allocations are avoided
- [ ] Proper use of concurrency patterns
- [ ] Resource leaks are prevented (file handles, goroutines, etc.)
