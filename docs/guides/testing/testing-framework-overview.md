# OneMount Testing Framework Overview

## Overview

The OneMount Testing Framework is a comprehensive testing infrastructure designed to support various types of testing for the OneMount filesystem. It provides a structured approach to testing, with components for unit testing, integration testing, system testing, performance testing, load testing, and security testing.

This guide provides a detailed overview of the test framework architecture, API documentation for all components, examples of how to use each component, and best practices for writing different types of tests.

## Architecture

The OneMount Test Framework is built around a core `TestFramework` class that provides centralized test configuration and execution. This core framework is extended by specialized frameworks for different types of testing:

### Core Components

1. **TestFramework**: The central component that provides test configuration, resource management, mock provider registration, test execution, and context management.

2. **NetworkSimulator**: Simulates different network conditions for testing, including latency, packet loss, bandwidth limitations, and network disconnections.

3. **MockProviders**: Mock implementations of system components for isolated testing, including:
   - MockGraphProvider: Simulates Microsoft Graph API responses
   - MockFileSystemProvider: Simulates filesystem operations
   - MockUIProvider: Simulates UI interactions

4. **CoverageReporter**: Collects and reports test coverage metrics, including line, function, and branch coverage.

### Specialized Frameworks

1. **IntegrationTestEnvironment**: Provides a controlled environment for integration tests, with support for component isolation, network simulation, and test data management.

2. **SystemTestEnvironment**: Extends the integration test environment for system-level testing, with support for end-to-end scenarios and production-like data volumes.

3. **PerformanceBenchmark**: Provides utilities for performance testing, including metrics collection, threshold checking, and result visualization.

4. **SecurityTestFramework**: Extends the test framework with security-specific testing capabilities, including vulnerability scanning and security control verification.
