# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for reference.

## Purpose

Documents are moved here when they:
- Are superseded by newer documentation
- Describe deprecated features or approaches
- Contain historical context that may be useful for reference
- Are no longer relevant to current development

## Guidelines

- Archived documents should include a note at the top indicating:
  - When they were archived
  - Why they were archived
  - What documentation (if any) supersedes them
- Do not delete archived documents without good reason
- Link to archived documents from current documentation when providing historical context
