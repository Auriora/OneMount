**Issue Reference**:
- Updated issue heading from "Issue 1" to "Issue #XDG-001"

## Issue Numbering System

The verification tracking document uses a structured issue numbering system:

- **#001-#009**: Core issues (numbered sequentially)
- **#FS-001-#FS-005**: File Status / D-Bus issues
- **#PERF-001-#PERF-008**: Performance issues
- **#XDG-001**: XDG integration issues (new category)

This structure allows for:
- Logical grouping of related issues
- Easy identification of issue category
- Preservation of existing issue numbers
- Room for future issues in each category

## Files Modified

1. `docs/verification-tracking.md` - Issue numbering and Task 5.4 status
2. `docs/verification-phase5-mounting.md` - Task 5.4 completion and requirements
3. `TASK_5.4_COMPLETE.md` - Issue reference correction
4. `docs/reports/2025-11-12-063800-task-5.4-filesystem-operations.md` - Issue reference

## Rationale

### Why Move the Issue to the End?

The verification tracking document has an established issue numbering system that should be preserved. Inserting a new issue in the middle would:
- Break existing issue references in other documents
- Require renumbering all subsequent issues
- Create confusion in issue tracking

By adding the new issue at the end with a category prefix (#XDG-001), we:
- Preserve all existing issue numbers
- Maintain document consistency
- Create a logical grouping for XDG-related issues
- Allow for future XDG issues (#XDG-002, etc.)

### Why Use #XDG-001 Instead of a Number?

The document already uses category prefixes for specialized issues:
- #FS-xxx for File Status issues
- #PERF-xxx for Performance issues

Adding #XDG-xxx for XDG integration issues:
- Follows the established pattern
- Makes the issue category immediately clear
- Allows for future XDG-related issues
- Keeps the issue list organized by category

## Verification

All changes have been verified to:
- ✅ Preserve existing issue numbers
- ✅ Maintain document consistency
- ✅ Accurately reflect Task 5.4 results
- ✅ Update all cross-references
- ✅ Follow documentation conventions

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Documentation updated
2. ⏭️ Proceed to Task 5.5 (Test unmounting and cleanup)
3. ⏭️ Proceed to Task 5.6 (Test signal handling)
