# v0.1.0 Release Documentation Update

**Date**: 2026-01-26  
**Task**: Task 47 - Update release documentation  
**Status**: Completed

## Summary

Updated all release documentation to reflect v0.1.0 as the first public release, removing all references to deprecated features, backward compatibility, and migration from previous versions.

## Changes Made

### Version Update
- Changed from v1.0.0 to v0.1.0 throughout all documentation
- Framed as first public release rather than major milestone
- Removed "Unreleased" section from CHANGELOG

### CHANGELOG.md
- Updated to v0.1.0 with "First Public Release" designation
- Removed "Changed" section (no previous version to change from)
- Removed "Deprecated" section (nothing to deprecate in first release)
- Reframed "Fixed" sections as feature descriptions rather than bug fixes
- Updated known issues to reference v0.2.0 instead of v1.0.1

### README.md
- Enhanced key features section with Socket.IO and ETag validation
- Updated project dependencies with detailed system requirements
- Maintained existing installation instructions and configuration

### Feature Guide (docs/guides/user/v0.1.0-features.md)
- Renamed from v1.0.0-features.md to v0.1.0-features.md
- Updated title and introduction for first release
- Removed migration and backward compatibility references
- Focused on feature descriptions rather than changes

### Release Notes (RELEASE_NOTES_v0.1.0.md)
- Renamed from RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md
- Reframed as first public release announcement
- Removed "Bug Fixes" section (no bugs to fix in first release)
- Removed migration guide (no previous version to migrate from)
- Updated acknowledgments for first release context
- Changed known issues to reference v0.2.0

## Rationale

v0.1.0 is more appropriate than v1.0.0 for a first public release because:
- Follows semantic versioning conventions
- v1.0.0 typically signals production-ready, mature software
- v0.1.0 indicates initial release with room for iteration
- No real-world usage yet to justify v1.0.0 stability claims
- Allows for breaking changes in 0.x series if needed

## Files Modified

- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/guides/user/v0.1.0-features.md` (renamed from v1.0.0-features.md)
- `RELEASE_NOTES_v0.1.0.md` (renamed from RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md)

## Rules Applied

- **documentation-conventions.md**: Followed documentation structure and placement guidelines
- **general-preferences.md**: Applied DRY principles, avoided duplication
- **git-conventions.md**: Prepared for proper commit message format

## Next Steps

1. Review all documentation for consistency
2. Verify all internal links work correctly
3. Create git commit with proper message format
4. Tag release as v0.1.0
5. Build and publish packages
