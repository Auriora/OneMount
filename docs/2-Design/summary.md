# OneDriver Repository Analysis

## Overview

This document summarizes the analysis of the OneDriver repository, listing all modules, classes, and their dependencies in JSON format as requested.

## Approach

1. **Repository Exploration**: First, I explored the repository structure to understand its organization. The main source code directories are:
   - `cmd/`: Command-line applications
   - `fs/`: Filesystem implementation
   - `ui/`: GUI implementation
   - `testutil/`: Testing utilities

2. **Code Analysis**: I created a Go script (`analyzer.go`) that uses Go's abstract syntax tree (AST) package to parse the Go source files and extract information about:
   - Packages (modules)
   - Structs (classes)
   - Methods and functions
   - Dependencies (imports)

3. **JSON Generation**: The script outputs the analysis results in JSON format, which includes:
   - Module information (name, path)
   - Class information (name, fields, methods, embedded types)
   - Function information (name, parameters, return values)
   - Dependency information (imported packages)

## Results

The analysis results are stored in `onedriver_modules.json`, which contains a comprehensive listing of all modules, classes, and their dependencies in the repository.

### Key Components Identified

1. **Filesystem Implementation** (`fs/` directory):
   - `Filesystem` struct: The main filesystem implementation
   - `Inode` struct: Represents files and directories
   - Graph API integration for OneDrive communication

2. **Command-line Applications** (`cmd/` directory):
   - `onedriver`: Main filesystem application
   - `onedriver-launcher`: GUI launcher application
   - Common utilities shared between applications

3. **GUI Implementation** (`ui/` directory):
   - GTK3-based user interface
   - Systemd integration

4. **Testing Utilities** (`testutil/` directory):
   - Test fixtures and helpers
   - Mock implementations for testing

## Conclusion

The OneDriver repository is a well-structured Go project that implements a native Linux filesystem for Microsoft OneDrive. The codebase is organized into logical modules with clear dependencies, making it maintainable and extensible.

The generated JSON file provides a comprehensive overview of the project's structure, which can be useful for documentation, dependency analysis, and onboarding new developers.
