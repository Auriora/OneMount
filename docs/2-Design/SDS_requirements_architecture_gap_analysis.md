## 2. Incomplete Implementation

The following requirements have partial implementation in the SDS but lack important details:

### 2.1 Offline Functionality

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Gap Description | Recommendation |
|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| FR-OFF-003 | The system shall automatically detect network connectivity changes. | Design only mentions offline attribute and retry logic, but lacks details on network detection | Enhance design with network connectivity monitoring components and state transition diagrams |
| FR-OFF-004 | The system shall synchronize changes made offline when connectivity is restored. | Design mentions UploadManager but lacks details on synchronization process | Add sequence diagrams for the synchronization process and conflict resolution |

### 2.2 Error Handling

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Gap Description | Recommendation |
|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| NFR-REL-001 | The system shall handle network errors and retry operations. | Design mentions retry logic but lacks details on backoff strategies and failure handling | Add detailed design for retry policies, timeout handling, and failure recovery |
| NFR-REL-004 | The system shall handle API rate limiting gracefully. | Design mentions rate limiting but lacks details on detection and throttling mechanisms | Add design details for rate limit detection, request queuing, and throttling implementation |

## 3. Architectural Decisions

The following architectural decisions from the SAS lack sufficient detail in the SDS:

| Architecture Decision | Gap Description | Recommendation |
|-----------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Structured logging with zerolog | Design mentions zerolog as a dependency but lacks details on logging architecture | Add design details for logging configuration, log levels, and integration throughout the system |
| Concurrent operations for uploads and downloads | Design mentions worker goroutines but lacks details on concurrency control and resource management | Add design details for worker pool management, resource limits, and error propagation |
| Local caching of metadata and content | Design includes cache classes but lacks details on cache invalidation and consistency | Add design details for cache coherence, invalidation policies, and size management |

## 4. Use Case Implementation Gaps

The following use cases have gaps in their implementation in the SDS:

| Use Case ID | Use Case Name | Gap Description | Recommendation |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| UC-STAT-001 | Analyze OneDrive Content with Statistics | No design specification for statistics functionality | Add complete design for statistics command implementation |
| UC-INT-001 | View File Status in Nemo File Manager | Partial implementation of D-Bus interface but missing Nemo integration | Add design details for Nemo extension and icon integration |
| UC-FS-003 | Handle File Conflicts | Design mentions conflict status but lacks details on conflict detection and resolution | Add sequence diagrams and detailed design for conflict scenarios |

## 5. Summary of Recommendations

1. **Add Missing Components**: Develop design specifications for statistics functionality, Nemo integration, and developer tools.
2. **Enhance Offline Functionality**: Provide more detailed design for network detection and synchronization processes.
3. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance design for retry logic, rate limiting, and crash recovery.
4. **Clarify Architectural Decisions**: Add more detail on logging architecture, concurrency control, and cache management.
5. **Complete Use Case Implementations**: Ensure all use cases have comprehensive design specifications.
6. **Address Non-Functional Requirements**: Develop design specifications for documentation, testing, and project structure.

By addressing these gaps, the Software Design Specification will provide a more complete implementation of the requirements and architectural decisions specified in the SRS and SAS.
