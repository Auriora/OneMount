# New Features in onedriver

Based on a thorough analysis of the codebase, documentation, and logs, the following new features have been identified in the onedriver project:

## 1. Enhanced Statistics Command

The `--stats` flag has been enhanced to provide more detailed metadata analysis:
- File type distribution
- Directory depth statistics
- File size distribution
- File age information derived from the bbolt database

This enhancement allows users to gain deeper insights into their OneDrive content without having to mount the filesystem.

## 2. D-Bus Interface for File Status Updates

A new D-Bus interface has been implemented for file status updates:
- Service Name: `org.onedriver.FileStatus`
- Object Path: `/org/onedriver/FileStatus`
- Interface: `org.onedriver.FileStatus`

This interface provides:
- Methods for getting file status
- Signals for file status changes

Benefits:
- Real-time updates without polling
- Reduced overhead compared to reading extended attributes
- Better integration with other applications

## 3. Nemo File Manager Integration

A new extension for the Nemo file manager has been added:
- Shows OneDrive as a network or cloud mount in the sidebar
- Displays file status icons (cloud, local, syncing, etc.)
- Uses the D-Bus interface for real-time status updates
- Falls back to reading extended attributes if D-Bus is not available

This integration makes it easier to identify and access OneDrive files in the Nemo file manager.

## 4. Enhanced Method Logging Framework

A comprehensive method logging framework has been implemented:
- Logs method entry and exit
- Captures parameters and return values
- Includes execution duration
- Uses structured logging with zerolog
- Provides goroutine ID for tracking concurrent operations

This framework improves debugging capabilities and enables workflow analysis.

## 5. Developer Tools

Several new developer tools have been added:

### 5.1 Workflow Analyzer
- Executes primary workflows (file upload, download, conflict resolution)
- Logs the sequence of invoked functions
- Generates PlantUML sequence diagrams
- Helps developers understand the internal workings of onedriver

### 5.2 Code Complexity Analyzer
- Calculates cyclomatic complexity of all functions and methods
- Identifies complex code that may be difficult to maintain
- Outputs results to a CSV file for analysis
- Helps improve code quality

## 6. Developer Documentation

New developer documentation has been added:
- Development Guidelines (DEVELOPMENT.md)
- Method Logging Framework documentation
- Workflow Analysis documentation
- D-Bus Interface specification
- Code Complexity Analyzer documentation

This documentation makes it easier for new developers to understand and contribute to the project.

## 7. Test Suite Enhancements

The test suite has been enhanced with:
- Go tests for the D-Bus interface
- Python pytest tests for the Nemo extension
- Offline tests that simulate network disconnection

These enhancements improve test coverage and ensure the reliability of the new features.

## Conclusion

These new features significantly enhance onedriver's functionality, usability, and developer experience. The D-Bus interface and Nemo integration improve the user experience, while the enhanced statistics command provides better insights into OneDrive content. The developer tools and documentation make it easier for new contributors to understand and improve the codebase.
