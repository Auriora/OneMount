// Package logging provides standardized logging utilities for the OneMount project.
// This file defines console writer functionality.
//
// While the default logging output is JSON for machine parsing, human-readable
// console output is often more useful during development and debugging. This file
// provides a console writer that formats log entries in a human-friendly way.
//
// The console writer can be customized with different output destinations and
// time formats to suit different development environments.
//
// This file is part of the consolidated logging package structure, which includes:
//   - logger.go: Core logger implementation and level management
//   - context.go: Context-aware logging functionality
//   - method.go: Method entry/exit logging (both with and without context)
//   - error.go: Error logging functionality
//   - performance.go: Performance optimization utilities
//   - constants.go: Constants used throughout the logging package
//   - console_writer.go (this file): Console writer functionality
