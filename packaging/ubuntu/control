Description: A native Linux filesystem for Microsoft OneDrive
 OneMount is a network filesystem that gives your computer direct access to your
 files on Microsoft OneDrive. This is not a sync client. Instead of syncing
 files, OneMount performs an on-demand download of files when your computer
 attempts to use them. OneMount allows you to use files on OneDrive as if they
 were files on your local computer.
 .
 Key features:
  * On-demand file access without local storage requirements
  * Native Linux filesystem integration via FUSE
  * Support for both personal and business OneDrive accounts
  * Automatic conflict resolution and offline synchronization
  * Desktop integration with file managers like Nemo and Nautilus
