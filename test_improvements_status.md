# Test Improvements Status

This document summarizes the status of the recommendations from the [test_improvements.md](test_improvements.md) document.

## Recommendations Status

### 1. Consistent Error Handling (COMPLETED)

**Implementation**: Added consistent error handling to all test setup files:
- `fs/graph/setup_test.go`: Added error handling for Chdir and OpenFile operations
- `cmd/common/setup_test.go`: Added error handling for Chdir, RemoveAll, and OpenFile operations
- `ui/setup_test.go`: Added zerolog import, logging setup, and error handling for Chdir, Remove, and Mkdir operations
- `ui/systemd/setup_test.go`: Added zerolog import, logging setup, and error handling for Chdir, Remove, and Mkdir operations

### 2. Proper State Checking Before Tests Start (COMPLETED)

**Implementation**: Successfully implemented in `fs/setup_test.go`. The implementation checks if the mount point is already in use by another process and attempts to unmount it if necessary. It first tries a normal unmount, and if that fails, it tries a lazy unmount. If both unmount attempts fail, it warns the user but continues with the tests.

### 3. Proper Cleanup After Tests Finish (COMPLETED)

**Implementation**: Already implemented in `fs/setup_test.go`. The implementation captures the initial state of the filesystem before running tests, and then in a deferred function, it captures the final state and compares it with the initial state to identify files that weren't cleaned up. It then attempts to clean up those files.

### 4. Recovery from Failures (COMPLETED)

**Implementation**: Implemented in `fs/setup_test.go`. The implementation adds retries for unmounting, with a timeout and better error handling. It first tries a normal unmount, and if that fails, it tries a lazy unmount with up to 3 retries, waiting 500ms between retries.

### 5. Consistent Use of t.Cleanup() (COMPLETED)

**Implementation**: Already implemented in `fs/fs_test.go` and `fs/offline/offline_test.go`. Both files consistently use `t.Cleanup()` to ensure resources are cleaned up even if tests fail.

### 6. Reduce Duplication (COMPLETED)

**Implementation**: Created a new package `testutil` with common test utility functions:
- `ui_test_utils.go`: Contains functions for UI test setup, including `SetupUITest` and `EnsureMountPoint`
- `fs_test_utils.go`: Contains functions for FS test setup, including `CaptureFileSystemState`, `CheckAndUnmountMountPoint`, `WaitForMount`, `UnmountWithRetries`, `CleanupFilesystemState`, and `StopFilesystemServices`

Updated `ui/setup_test.go` and `ui/systemd/setup_test.go` to use these common functions, reducing duplication between these files.

### 7. Improve Documentation (COMPLETED)

**Implementation**: Added comprehensive documentation to the `TestMain` functions in:
- `fs/setup_test.go`: Added detailed documentation explaining the setup and teardown process, including 12 setup steps and 6 teardown steps
- `fs/offline/setup_test.go`: Added detailed documentation explaining the setup and teardown process for offline tests, including 14 setup steps and 5 teardown steps

## Next Steps

All recommendations have been implemented. The test setup and teardown code is now more consistent, robust, and well-documented across the project.
