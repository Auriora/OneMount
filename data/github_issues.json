It returns a function that can be\n// called to stop signal handling.\nfunc (tf *TestFramework) SetupSignalHandling() func() {\n    // Implementation details...\n}\n```\n\n### Key Features\n1. **Signal Registration**: Registers handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM signals\n2. **Thread Safety**: Uses mutex to ensure thread-safe signal handling setup and teardown\n3. **Idempotent Operation**: Multiple calls to SetupSignalHandling only register handlers once\n4. **Cleanup Function**: Returns a function that can be called to stop signal handling\n5. **Resource Cleanup**: Ensures all registered resources are properly cleaned up when signals are received\n\n### Implementation Approach\n- Added new fields to TestFramework struct to track signal handling state\n- Used a channel to receive OS signals\n- Implemented a goroutine to handle signals asynchronously\n- Ensured proper cleanup of resources when signals are received\n- Added comprehensive logging for signal handling events\n\n### Testing\nAdded three test cases to verify the implementation:\n1. **TestUT_FW_10_01_SetupSignalHandling_ValidFramework_RegistersSignalHandlers**: Verifies that signal handling is set up correctly\n2. **TestUT_FW_10_02_SetupSignalHandlingIdempotent_CalledTwice_OnlyRegistersOnce**: Verifies that calling SetupSignalHandling twice only registers handlers once\n3. **TestUT_FW_10_03_CleanupResourcesOnSignal_ResourceAdded_ResourceCleaned**: Verifies that resources are cleaned up when a signal is received\n\n## Usage Example\n```go\nfunc TestExample(t *testing.T) {\n    // Create a test framework\n    framework := NewTestFramework(TestConfig{}, logger)\n    \n    // Set up signal handling\n    cleanup := framework.SetupSignalHandling()\n    defer cleanup() // Stop signal handling when the test completes\n    \n    // Add resources to the framework\n    framework.AddResource(resource1)\n    framework.AddResource(resource2)\n    \n    // Run tests...\n    // If the test is interrupted by a signal, resources will be cleaned up\n}\n```\n\n## Benefits\n1. **Prevents Resource Leaks**: Ensures resources are cleaned up even when tests are interrupted\n2. **Improves Test Reliability**: Prevents test environment corruption from interrupted tests\n3. **Simplifies Test Writing**: Developers don't need to implement custom signal handling in tests\n\nThis implementation satisfies all the requirements specified in Issue #107 and follows the project's coding standards and best practices.\n\nCloses #107",

    "body": "# Test Sandbox Guidelines for OneMount\n\n## Overview\n\nThis document provides guidelines for using the test-sandbox directory in the OneMount project. It outlines best practices for test working folders, including proper usage, cleanup procedures, isolation between tests, naming conventions, and resource management.\n\n## Current Structure and Usage\n\nThe test-sandbox directory is currently used as the main test working folder for the OneMount project. It contains various test artifacts, including:\n\n1. **Log Files**: `fusefs_tests.log` - Contains logs from test runs\n2. **Mount Point**: `tmp/mount` - Where the filesystem is mounted during tests\n3. **Test Files**: `dmel.fa` - A large test file used for upload session tests\n4. **Authentication Tokens**: `.auth_tokens.json` - Contains authentication tokens for tests\n5. **Test Database**: `tmp` - Contains the test database and other temporary files\n6. **Content and Thumbnails**: `tmp/test/content` and `tmp/test/thumbnails` - Directories for test content and thumbnails\n\nThe test-sandbox directory is defined in `internal/testutil/test_constants.go` with the following structure:\n\n```\ntest-sandbox/                  (TestSandboxDir)\n├── .auth_tokens.json          (AuthTokensPath)\n├── dmel.fa                    (DmelfaDir)\n├── fusefs_tests.log           (TestLogPath)\n└── tmp/                       (TestSandboxTmpDir)\n    ├── test/\n    │   ├── content/\n    │   └── thumbnails/\n    └── mount/                 (TestMountPoint)\n        └── onemount_tests/    (TestDir)\n            └── delta/         (DeltaDir)\n```\n\n## Recommended Structure Outside the Project\n\nTo improve test isolation and avoid cluttering the project directory, we recommend moving the test-sandbox directory outside of the project. This can be achieved by:\n\n1. Creating a dedicated directory for test artifacts outside the project directory\n2. Updating the constants in `internal/testutil/test_constants.go` to use this external directory\n3. Ensuring all tests use the constants from `testutil` rather than hardcoded paths\n\nThe recommended structure is:\n\n```\n$HOME/.onemount-tests/                  (TestSandboxDir)\n├── .auth_tokens.json                   (AuthTokensPath)\n├── dmel.fa                             (DmelfaDir)\n├── logs/\n│   └── fusefs_tests.log                (TestLogPath)\n├── tmp/                                (TestSandboxTmpDir)\n│   ├── test/\n│   │   ├── content/\n│   │   └── thumbnails/\n│   └── mount/                          (TestMountPoint)\n│       └── onemount_tests/             (TestDir)\n│           └── delta/                  (DeltaDir)\n└── graph_test_dir/                     (New directory for graph tests)\n```\n\n## Best Practices for Test Working Folders\n\n### Proper Usage in Tests\n\n1. **Use Constants**: Always use the constants defined in `internal/testutil/test_constants.go` rather than hardcoded paths.\n2. **Avoid Direct Manipulation**: Do not directly manipulate the test-sandbox directory in tests. Use the provided utility functions in `internal/testutil/setup.go`.\n3. **Respect Directory Structure**: Maintain the directory structure defined in the constants. Do not create additional directories or files in the test-sandbox directory unless necessary.\n4. **Test Isolation**: Each test should operate in its own subdirectory to avoid conflicts with other tests.\n5. **Resource Limits**: Be mindful of resource usage, especially when creating large files or many small files.\n\n### Cleanup Procedures\n\n1. **Clean Up After Tests**: Always clean up any files or directories created during tests.\n2. **Use t.Cleanup()**: Use the `t.Cleanup()` function to register cleanup functions that will be called even if tests fail.\n3. **Temporary Files**: Store temporary files in the `tmp` directory, which is cleaned up between test runs.\n4. **Persistent Files**: Store files that need to persist between test runs (e.g., authentication tokens) in the root of the test-sandbox directory.\n5. **Unmount Before Cleanup**: Always unmount the filesystem before attempting to clean up the mount point.\n\n### Isolation Between Tests\n\n1. **Unique Test Directories**: Each test should use a unique directory to avoid conflicts with other tests.\n2. **Parallel Tests**: When running tests in parallel, ensure they do not share resources.\n3. **Clean State**: Start each test with a clean state by removing and recreating test directories.\n4. **Independent Tests**: Tests should not depend on the state created by other tests.\n5. **Mock Dependencies**: Use mock implementations of external dependencies to improve isolation.\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\n1. **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive names for test files and directories.\n2. **Test-Specific Prefixes**: Prefix test files and directories with the test name to avoid conflicts.\n3. **Temporary File Suffix**: Use a `.tmp` suffix for temporary files.\n4. **Test Data Files**: Store test data files in a `testdata` directory.\n5. **Log Files**: Store log files in a `logs` directory with descriptive names.\n\n### Resource Management\n\n1. **Limit File Sizes**: Keep test files as small as possible while still being useful for testing.\n2. **Clean Up Resources**: Always clean up resources after tests, especially large files.\n3. **Reuse Test Files**: Reuse test files when possible instead of creating new ones.\n4. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Use the profiler to monitor resource usage during tests.\n5. **Limit Concurrent Operations**: Use semaphores to limit concurrent operations and prevent resource exhaustion.\n\n## Specific Recommendations for Test Artifacts\n\n### fusefs_tests.log\n\n- Move to `$HOME/.onemount-tests/logs/fusefs_tests.log`\n- Implement log rotation to prevent the log file from growing too large\n- Add timestamps to log entries for better debugging\n\n### mount-point\n\n- Move to `$HOME/.onemount-tests/tmp/mount`\n- Ensure it's unmounted and cleaned up after tests\n- Use a unique mount point for each test run to avoid conflicts\n\n### dmel.fa\n\n- Move to `$HOME/.onemount-tests/dmel.fa`\n- Consider generating this file on demand instead of storing it\n- Implement a mechanism to verify the file's integrity before using it\n\n### graph_test_dir\n\n- Create a new directory at `$HOME/.onemount-tests/graph_test_dir`\n- Use this directory for graph API tests\n- Implement proper cleanup procedures for this directory\n\n### test/\n\n- Move to `$HOME/.onemount-tests/tmp/test`\n- Ensure it's cleaned up between test runs\n- Use subdirectories for different types of tests (e.g., content, thumbnails)\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\nWhen implementing these recommendations, consider the following:\n\n1. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure that existing tests continue to work with the new structure.\n2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to allow overriding the test-sandbox location.\n3. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new structure and best practices.\n4. **CI/CD Integration**: Ensure that CI/CD pipelines are updated to use the new structure.\n5. **Test Helpers**: Create helper functions to simplify working with the new structure.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMoving the test-sandbox directory outside of the project will improve test isolation, reduce clutter in the project directory, and make it easier to manage test artifacts. By following the best practices outlined in this document, we can ensure that tests are reliable, maintainable, and efficient.",

        "body": "# Issue #59: Standardize Error Handling Across Modules - Implementation Complete\n\nI've completed the implementation of standardized error handling across the OneMount project. Here's a summary of the work done:\n\n## Changes Made\n\n1. **Created Standardized Error Handling Package**\n   - Implemented `internal/common/errors` package with standardized error handling functions\n   - Added specialized error types for common error scenarios (NetworkError, NotFoundError, AuthError, etc.)\n   - Implemented structured logging with context propagation\n   - Added comprehensive tests for all new functionality\n\n2. **Updated Key Files with Standardized Error Handling**\n   - Updated `internal/fs/graph/graph.go` with specialized error types and structured logging\n   - Updated `internal/fs/thumbnail_operations.go` with standardized error handling\n   - Updated `internal/fs/metadata_operations.go` with standardized error handling\n   - Updated several other files in the `internal/fs` directory\n\n3. **Created Documentation**\n   - Created comprehensive error handling guidelines\n   - Created examples of using specialized error types\n   - Created examples of structured logging\n   - Created a plan for monitoring and refining error handling based on real-world usage\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Improved Traceability**: Errors now maintain their chain, making it easier to trace the root cause\n2. **Consistent Logging**: Standardized field names and logging patterns make logs more consistent and easier to parse\n3. **Reduced Duplication**: Common error handling patterns are now centralized in a single package\n4. **Better Context**: Errors now include more context about where and why they occurred\n5. **Type Safety**: Specialized error types make it easier to handle specific error conditions\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWhile the core implementation is complete, there are still some files that need to be updated with the new error handling patterns. I've created a plan for completing this work:\n\n1. **Continue Updating Remaining Files**\n   - Focus on high-traffic code paths and error-prone areas\n   - Prioritize files in the `internal/fs` directory that handle user operations\n   - Update test files to use the new error handling patterns\n\n2. **Expand Structured Logging Implementation**\n   - Add more context information to logs for better debugging\n   - Ensure consistent use of field names across all modules\n   - Implement request tracing for operations that span multiple components\n\n3. **Monitor and Refine Error Handling**\n   - Collect feedback from developers using the new error handling patterns\n   - Identify any additional specialized error types needed\n   - Refine documentation based on common questions and issues\n\n## Documentation\n\nI've created the following documentation to help developers understand and use the new error handling patterns:\n\n1. **Error Handling Guidelines**: A comprehensive guide to error handling in the OneMount project\n2. **Error Handling Examples**: Examples of how to use the standardized error handling approach\n3. **Error Handling Monitoring Plan**: A plan for monitoring and refining error handling based on real-world usage\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe standardized error handling implementation has significantly improved the quality and maintainability of the OneMount codebase. By providing a comprehensive set of error handling utilities, specialized error types, and structured logging capabilities, we've established a consistent approach to error handling across the project.\n\nThe implementation in key files demonstrates how these patterns can be applied to improve error handling in complex, error-prone areas of the codebase. By continuing to roll out these patterns to the rest of the codebase, we'll further enhance the reliability and maintainability of the OneMount project.",
